    <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 10, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for supporting The Muslim Post. This policy outlines the terms regarding cancellations and refunds for our services.</p>

    <h2>1. Subscription Cancellations</h2>
    <p>You can cancel your recurring subscription at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. You will continue to have access to our premium content until the end of that period.</p>
    <p>To cancel your subscription, please visit your account profile page or contact our support team.</p>

    <h2>2. Refund Policy for Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Due to the digital nature of our content, all subscription payments made to The Muslim Post are **non-refundable**. When you purchase a subscription, you gain immediate access to our content, and we cannot reverse this access. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods or unused content.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Policy for Donations</h2>
    <p>Donations are voluntary contributions made to support our journalism and are **strictly non-refundable**. We are incredibly grateful for your support, but we are unable to process refunds for donations once they have been made.</p>

    <h2>4. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
    <p>We may consider refunds on a case-by-case basis for exceptional circumstances, such as a billing error on our part. If you believe you have been charged in error, please contact our support team within 7 days of the transaction with the relevant details.</p>
