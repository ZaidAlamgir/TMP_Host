    <h1>Editorial Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 22, 2025 </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction & Our Mission</h2>
    <p>These guidelines outline the core principles and standards that underpin all journalism produced by The Muslim Post. Our mission is to provide **accurate, fair, impartial, and insightful** news and analysis, particularly concerning issues relevant to Muslim communities globally and within India. We aim to foster informed communities through reporting that is rooted in integrity and respect. These guidelines apply to all content creators, including staff writers, editors, and contributing members.</p>
    <p>We believe that trust is the foundation of good journalism. These standards are designed to ensure we earn and maintain the trust of our audience.</p>

    <h2>2. Accuracy & Fact-Checking</h2>
    <p>Accuracy is paramount. We strive to ensure that all the factual information we publish is correct and presented in context.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> We take reasonable steps to verify information before publication, using primary sources whenever possible. Claims, statements, and data should be cross-checked.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> We distinguish clearly between established facts, claims, speculation, and opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrections:</strong> We correct significant errors as promptly and clearly as possible. (See Section 7: Corrections Policy).</li>
        <li><strong>Precision:</strong> We aim for precision in language, headlines, images, and all other content elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Impartiality & Fairness</h2>
    <p>We are committed to reflecting a wide range of views and perspectives without bias, ensuring that our reporting is fair to all subjects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance:</strong> In covering controversies, we aim to represent significant viewpoints fairly and give individuals or groups subject to criticism a reasonable opportunity to respond.</li>
        <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Our reporting should be based on evidence and facts, not personal opinion or prejudice. When opinion or analysis is presented, it must be clearly labeled as such. (See Section 5: Opinion & Analysis).</li>
        <li><strong>Avoiding Bias:</strong> Writers and editors must be aware of their own potential biases and strive to prevent them from influencing their work. Language used should be neutral and respectful.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong> Staff and contributors must declare any potential conflicts of interest (financial, personal, political) that could compromise their impartiality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sourcing & Attribution</h2>
    <p>Transparency about our sources is crucial for credibility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> We attribute information clearly to its source, allowing the audience to judge its credibility. Direct quotes should be accurate.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Anonymous sources should only be used when necessary to protect the source from harm or reprisal, and only with editorial approval. The reason for anonymity should be explained to the audience as clearly as possible without compromising the source. Information from anonymous sources often requires corroboration.</li>
        <li><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. All borrowed material (text, images, data) must be properly credited.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification of User Content:</strong> Content generated by users (e.g., comments, posts from members) requires careful handling and clear labeling to distinguish it from professionally produced journalism. (See Section 9: User-Generated Content).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Opinion & Analysis</h2>
    <p>We value informed opinion and analysis, but it must be clearly distinguished from factual reporting.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Opinion pieces, editorials, analysis, and reviews must be clearly labeled to differentiate them from news reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Basis in Fact:</strong> While opinion pieces express a viewpoint, they should still be grounded in factual accuracy and avoid misrepresenting information.</li>
        <li><strong>Range of Opinion:</strong> We aim to host a diverse range of opinions on our platform, reflecting different perspectives within the communities we cover.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Privacy & Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>We respect individual privacy and handle sensitive subjects with care, particularly when dealing with vulnerable individuals or traumatic events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intrusion:</strong> We weigh the public interest against the right to privacy. Intrusion into private lives requires strong justification.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We strive to obtain informed consent when dealing with minors or vulnerable individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphic Content:</strong> We carefully consider the use of graphic images or descriptions, providing warnings where appropriate, and ensuring their use is editorially justified.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect:</strong> We treat subjects of our reporting with respect and dignity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Corrections Policy</h2>
    <p>We are committed to transparency and accountability. When we make errors, we correct them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Promptness:</strong> Significant factual errors will be corrected promptly upon verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Corrections will clearly state the error and provide the correct information.</li>
        <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Corrections will be published with sufficient visibility, typically appended to the original article or published in a dedicated corrections section, depending on the significance of the error.</li>
        <li><strong>How to Report Errors:</strong> Readers can report potential errors by contacting us at <a href="mailto:themuslimpostofficial@gmail.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">themuslimpostofficial@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Correction Request".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Independence</h2>
    <p>The Muslim Post maintains editorial independence from political, commercial, or special interests. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Editorial Decisions:</strong> Editorial decisions are made by editors based on journalistic merit, free from undue influence by owners, advertisers, or any external parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Advertising content must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content. Advertisers do not influence news coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sponsored Content:</strong> Any sponsored content or partnerships will be clearly labeled as such.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Content created by our registered users or members (e.g., through the "Post" feature) represents the views of the individual authors and not necessarily those of The Muslim Post. However, contributors are expected to adhere to our community standards and Terms of Service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> We reserve the right to moderate or remove user-generated content that violates our terms (e.g., hate speech, misinformation, personal attacks, copyright infringement). </li>
        <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> User-generated content should be clearly distinguishable from content produced by staff journalists and editors. Profile information (like author qualification entered on `post.html`) helps provide context but is user-provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The Muslim Post does not typically fact-check user-generated posts with the same rigor as staff-produced content, though egregious falsehoods may be removed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Accountability</h2>
    <p>We are accountable to our audience. We welcome feedback and criticism regarding our adherence to these guidelines.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Concerns or complaints about our editorial content can be directed to <a href="mailto:themuslimpostofficial@gmail.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">themuslimpostofficial@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> These guidelines will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.</li>
    </ul>
