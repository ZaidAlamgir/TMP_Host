Israeli‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ forces keep on their aggressive air strikes that have destroyed the homes of several families, hospitals, and made the camps uninhabitable as Gaza undergoes one of the darkest chapters of its history. The worldwide audience sees not a “conflict” but a systematic massacre - genocide of the Palestinians. Ashamedly, however, the United Arab Emirates is siding with Israel, not the victims by, among other things, deepening trade, military, and diplomatic relations.

Relations between Israel and the UAE have been intensifying quickly after the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020. The friendship went so far even when Gaza was dying of war from defense cooperation to billion-dollar trade deals. Just in the past two years, the UAE has made it possible for Israeli arms manufacturers to enter its market and show the weapons in use for killing innocents, without hesitation. A lot of Muslims and Arabs, therefore, have found with this development that the UAE's alliance might be with Israel after all rather than with the Muslim and Arab world.

This partnership is not the practice of diplomacy but the betrayal of the Palestinians. With every rocket fired at Gaza, every airstrike on the homes, the failure of the Arab states that watch and do nothing is made audible. While the UAE keeps Israel as a good business partner, funding the latter's technology, energy, and defense industries, it sends a very bad signal of: Arab unity and solidarity are no longer there, they have been overtaken by economic ambition and political convenience.

As a country on the cutting edge of technology and with an eye to the future, the UAE cannot really claim moral progress if it is helping an aggressor who is flagrantly violating international laws and human rights. To provide comfort and convenience to the Israeli dignitaries and weapon companies at a time when Palestinian kids are being buried in the debris of their homes is a moral failure—a stain on the collective conscience of the Arab world.

When Palestinians are in dire need of justice, the UAE teaming up with Israel is like putting a knife in their back. It’s not neutrality; it’s complicity. A country from the Arab world that decides to side with the oppressor rather than the oppressed cannot talk about brotherhood, faith, or unity anymore.

The UAE, in the opinion of many, has gone beyond a historical red line. While Gaza is still crying, the UAE trades. While the Palestinians lose their homes and lives, the Israeli companies are extending their reach through the UAE markets. This is not the Arab world's dream of peace, rather, it is the normalization of betrayal laid upon the ruins of ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌Palestine.
