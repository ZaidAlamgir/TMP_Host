Putin,‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the President of Russia, stated that the country has effectively tested the 9M730 Burevestnik, which is the NATO designation for the SSC-X-9 Skyfall - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable, intercontinental cruising missile that was said to have a "theoretical unlimited range" and was capable of escaping the latest missile defense systems.

Putin said that the missile was in the air for around 15 hours and covered a distance of about 14,000 kilometers and thus, he saw this as a major breakthrough in military technology. He told Russian media that the Burevestnik is "unique in the world" and that Russia is already making the necessary arrangements for its deployment.

The goal behind the Burevestnik project is essentially to equip Russia with a weapon that can thrill the enemy radar with its low-flying and changing routes so that it is very difficult for the enemy radar to detect or intercept. The missile's nuclear power, essentially, allows it to stay in the air for long periods - way beyond the ranges of normal missiles.

However, Western intelligence services have doubted that the weapon is ready for operational deployment. The program has been marred with failures in test runs and radiation leaks have been reported in accidents. In addition, experts point to the fact that the idea of a nuclear-powered cruise missile inevitably entails technical and environmental risks, the most important of which is the possibility of a crash site contaminated with radioactive materials.

The analysts consider the test as a strategic move by Moscow that is aimed at enhancing its bargaining power in face of the ongoing conflicts with NATO and the United States. Through the Burevestnik triumph, Russia defies the West by affirming that it is still actively working on unconventional armaments that are hard for Western missile-defense systems to cope with and attract less countries to the global nuclear club.

However, the issue of the missile's dependability and usefulness has not been resolved yet. A lot of military specialists, in spite of Putin’s outspoken confidence, think that making a safe, fully operable nuclear-powered cruise missile is still among the toughest problems of modern weapon technology.
