In‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ a bold and divisive move, the Oxford Union voted by 265 to 113 in support of the motion that Israel is a greater threat to Middle Eastern stability than Iran. The debate on November 13th was a packed event and reactions were immediately felt both in the chamber and outside of it.

## A very Divisive and High-Stakes Motion

The debate was very much influenced by the current tragic war in Gaza and the already tenacious Iran-West conflict. Other than former Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, and former Iranian minister Ata'ollah Mohajerani, the panel also had UN Watch's executive director Hillel Neuer and former British ambassador Dominick Chilcott, among others.

The final decision made reflected both the arguments put forward during the debate and die students' mood, who believe that the region has become even more unstable than before.

## Arguments in Support of the Motion: "Israel Is Destabilizing the Region"

The motion proponents declared that the most damaging and destabilizing effects of Israel's work-largely its military campaign in Gaza-have been felt not only by Palestine but have also had a significant impact on the rest of the world becoming deeply destabilized.

#### 1. Military actions in Gaza undermining global order

Mohammed Shtayyeh had described the Israeli attack as unlawful and catastrophical for humanity and went on to say that "international law is left without any meaning". Part of the proof that was given referred to the killing of innocent civilians, the destruction of infrastructure, and the forced exodus of almost the entire population.

#### 2. Long history of regional interventions

By pointing to the military actions of the Israel in Lebanon and Syria, as well as other places in the Middle East, supporters argued that the consequences of that have been escalating the conflict and the involvement of the superpowers indirectly combating each other.

#### 3. Nuclear ambiguity

Their nuclear possession being the one that is not declared but globally accepted, the speakers referred to it as the core of unfriendly environmental factors in question that result in an unsecure situation.

#### 4. Expansionist policies

Apart from the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and the removal of the Palestinians that was used to illustrate an expanding agenda whose reverberations were felt not only in the region but throughout the world as well.

## Arguments Against the Motion: "Iran Is the Real Threat"

They argued that influence of Iran ideological model, the militias controlled from the region, and activities connected to nuclear program, are elements that constitute the biggest threat to tranquility.

#### 1. Iran's "proxy network"

Hillel Neuer maintained that by sponsoring Hezbollah, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq and Syria, Iran has not only destabilized the four nations and the Middle East in general, but it has also added up the killing of thousands by these groups as a supposed consequence.

Nevertheless, critics argue that as a result of Israel's own military actions thousands of Palestinians have died, most of them in Gaza, and thus it is not quite consistent to blame only Iran for the bloodshed in the region.

#### 2. Internal repression and exported militancy

Them arguing, they stated Iran's ideological-based, repressive system inside the country is the root of the uprising externally as well where it is influencing soon-to-be neighbors that are already upended states.

#### 3. Nuclear ambitions

Opponents presented Iran's nuclear program as a threat that could become very serious in the long-term and hinted at the risk of escalation for the future.

Neuer's claim that Gaza might have been "a lovely waterfront area" caused quite an uproar and the audience's visible objection was their response.

## A Vote With Symbolic Weight

The Oxford Union vote does not have any political influence but it is characterized by a certain symbolic importance as it is considered to be an indicator of shifting public opinion, especially among the young. Many people tend to look at Israel nowadays as the biggest troublemaker in the Middle East because of how many times it has bombed the countries around it and its persistent military operations to which the region is very ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌sensitive.
