The primary, lived reality for a vast portion of India's 200 million Muslims is one of stark and deteriorating economic exclusion. This is not a passive lag in development but a systemic, and accelerating, unraveling of the community's financial standing, pushing them to the absolute margins of the nation's economic life. From village to city, widespread discrimination in the job market to the systemic denial of institutional credit and the targeted destruction of Muslim-owned businesses, a clear architecture of financial alienation is being solidified. some even promoted by ruling party lawmakers 

This grim economic reality stands in sharp contrast to the foundational promise of an inclusive India. More than seven decades ago, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad ( one of country's founding fathers and the first education minister of india) speaking at Delhi's Jama Masjid, affirmed that the nation's destiny was incomplete without its Muslim citizens. Today, the community finds itself at a precarious crossroads where this deepening economic destitution is compounded by, and a driver of, its political and social isolation. This exclusion is not a passive byproduct of market forces but, increasingly, the result of active, discriminatory state policies and a resurgent majoritarian ideology that challenges the very foundations of India's secular contract. affecting indian muslims most

## 1. The Historical Legacy of Communal Violence.

The 1947 partition of British India cast a long and bloody shadow. It tragically framed the "Muslim question" in a binary of loyalty and belonging, a burden of proof that Muslims who remained in India have been forced to carry ever since. just because violence and political differences created a muslim country, from the muslim majority areas of british india. simply the indian muslims nothing to do with that, While the founders of the republic enshrined secularism and minority rights in the Constitution,the trauma of the partition violence has never been fully resolved. The past that is not fully explained has become a weapon for the politicians who use it as a tool to create more suspicion and alienation. The Muslim community which made a firm decision to go with India was the first one to be treated as a suspect population, a stereotype which has been very strong and is actively used in present-day political speeches that Muslims support Pakistan.

## 2. Recurring Riots and the Cycle of Displacement.

![Image Created by TMP Staff showing communal violence against Muslims over the last 50 years](https://i.ibb.co/5x8cFrS4/kmc-20251031-101312.webp)

Communal violence has been a recurring decimal in India's post-independence history, but its character has shifted. Far from being spontaneous clashes, modern riots are often analyzed as organized pogroms designed to terrorize, dispossess, and displace.The Malyana Massacre (1987), Nellie (1983), Delhi (1984), and Gujarat (2002) as well as the recent Delhi (2020) and 100s of Incident Where Dozens of Muslims Killed, are some of the places where this violence has not only directly taken lives and destroyed properties but has also caused long-term economic and social division.

Recent information reveals a worrying picture. A 2024 report from the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS) indicated an 84% rise in communal riots in 2024 as compared to 2023, with a large number of these riots taking place in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governed states. The main reason for these occurrences lately has been the religious processions passing through Muslim-majority areas, thus allegedly intentionally provoking attacks. This crime-hate cycle is successful in two ways: it first consolidates the majoritarian vote bank, and then, by gradually destroying the Muslim community's economic backbone, it makes them stay there in a state of constant weakness from where they can neither help themselves nor be taken out by others.

## 3. The Rise of Ghettoisation.

![The image depicts that Muslims are increasingly living in ghettos](https://i.ibb.co/ymmf0knk/kmc-20251031-101258.webp)

The most visible consequence of this recurring violence is spatial segregation. The 2006 Sachar Committee Report first officially raised the alarm, noting that "fearing for their security, Muslims are increasingly resorting to living in ghettos." This is not voluntary self-segregation. It is a forced retreat into enclaves driven by the hunt for physical safety. A Systematic enclave Formation by the Anti Muslim political Forces.

The urban areas where the majority of the population are Muslims in different parts of India have now "mini-Pakistans," a derogatory term which has even been used by the public officials. The localities like Juhapura in Ahmedabad, which got packed with refugees after the 2002 riots, or Mumbra near Mumbai, are the most noticeable examples. These ghettos are the places where the state has abandoned the people and they lack basic civic needs such as good schools, sanitation, and public utilities. This spatial separation is directly leading to social and economic separation, disconnecting the communities from the mainstream and hence, they are getting deprived of the most chances and becoming deeply rooted in their marginal status. Government and civic bodies are very clear about this: these areas should take their own responsibilities; it is not their (government's) responsibility.

## 4. Socio-Economic Disparities and Job Discrimination.

![Discrimination against Muslims in urban employment](https://i.ibb.co/C30m2tz5/thumbs-b-c-6b61a34dfec9aa866bf04541ffc6051f.jpg)

The data regarding the socio-economic condition of Indian Muslims is clear and convincing. The Sachar Committee Report very starkly pointed out that on numerous development indicators, the situation of Muslims was worse than that of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.They have the lowest Mean Years of Schooling, the lowest share of workers in the formal sector, and the poorest access to bank credit.

This is not only a problem of the past, but also an active and worsening crisis. The Oxfam "India Discrimination Report 2022" found that discrimination against Muslims in urban employment is on the rise. It found that in 2019-20, 68.3% of urban Muslims faced discrimination, which was a big jump from 59.3% in 2004-05. This discrimination comes out in real ways: qualified Muslims say that they have been denied jobs and housing only because of their names or the way they dress. Latest research also shows that Muslims are, on average, paid much less than their non-Muslim counterparts, with one study from 2024 (Centre for Development Policy and Practice) indicating that their average income is just a quarter of Hindu ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌incomes.

## 5.‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Educational Backwardness and Social Stigma.

![Due to an unfriendly social environment Muslims lag behind in educational attainment](https://i.ibb.co/C3vYvHmV/1761886367639822424-12d6da36-5e11-4f1d-a35d-2e909404a96c-2.webp)

As the primary means of social mobility, education is still unreachable for a large part of the population. The Sachar Report brought to light very high dropout rates, especially for girls, and low enrollment rates in higher education. The gap is still there even after several decades and in some cases has become even wider. According to the data, the rate of graduates without a job is highest among Muslims, thus leading to a crisis of hopelessness.

The lack of education is exacerbated by an unfriendly social environment. Features of Muslim identity such as the hijab are coming under attack more and more. The dispute in Karnataka, where Muslim girls wearing the hijab were not allowed to attend classes, is a strong indication of how social stigma is being institutionalized thereby coercing students to make a choice between their faith and their future. This environment, along with the widespread hate speech, leads to the creation of social stigma which in turn dehumanizes the community by branding them as "infiltrators" (ghuspathiya) or "termites" in the mainstream political discourse.

## 6. Under-Political Representation and a Democratic Deficit.

![In 1980, Muslim political representation was 49, but today it has declined to just 24–26.](https://i.ibb.co/5XL6CPHQ/kmc-20251031-101247.webp)

The political voice of the Muslim community has been deliberately and systematically weakened. In the 2024 Lok Sabha, only 24-26 Muslim MPs were elected out of 543-member house. This means that the Muslim community, which makes up 14.2% of the population, has been represented by only about 4.5% of the Parliament, a huge democratic deficit.This is a historic low, down from a high of 49 MPs in 1980. Indian Muslims loosing their grip in India's Political Landscape. Other secular parties using Muslims only as there political tool or Votebanks.

The BJP which is the ruling party and has achieved dominant electoral victories is doing so without requiring significant Muslim representation. It barely had any Muslim candidates contesting in non-Muslim-majority areas during the 2019 and 2024 elections. As a result of this political invisibilization, the issues faced by the community, be it safety or development, do not get mentioned in the highest councils of policy-making. As of late 2024, there was not even one Muslim minister in the Union Cabinet, a symbolic and real vacancy in a country of 200 million Muslims.

## 7. Legal and Institutional Mechanisms of Exclusion.

![BJP’s tactics to institutionalize the exclusion of Indian Muslims](https://i.ibb.co/YFVHdgGK/kmc-20251031-101236.webp)

In recent years, marginalization has shifted from de facto (in practice) to de jure (in law). A new architecture of legal and institutional mechanisms has been constructed to formalize exclusion.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019: By this law, for the first time, religion is used as a criterion for Indian citizenship. It singles out non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries for a speedy citizenship process and at the same time, it is very clear that Muslims are the ones who are being excluded.

The Question here is Muslims are not the part of this Country? If Hindus of Other countries can refugee and live here even gets Citizenship then why Muslims of Neighbouring countries not Allowed? 


The National Register of Citizens (NRC): When paired with the CAA, the NRC (an exercise to identify "genuine" citizens) creates a profound sense of fear. Critics argue the combination is a filter designed to disenfranchise Muslims who may lack legacy documentation, while providing a "safety net" for non-Muslims via the CAA. After Both CAA and NRC Mix with each other it will create problems for Millions of Muslims in India and May Be like Rohingyas of Bangladesh 


Anti-Conversion and Cow-Slaughter Laws: Ostensibly for social reform or animal protection, these laws are disproportionately weaponized against Muslims. They have been used to police interfaith marriages (the love jihad conspiracy) and criminalize the traditional livelihoods of Muslim butchers and cattle traders, often with the backing of vigilante groups. These groups have government, police and legal backing in some states or Areas.

Institutional Bias: This exclusion is mirrored in the state machinery. Muslim representation in the bureaucracy (4% of IAS, 3% of IPS) and judiciary (dropping from 12% in 1947 to 4% in 2024) is shockingly low, leading to a profound lack of trust in the state's impartiality. From politics to beaurocracy Muslims are under Representation

## 8. Intersectionality: Caste, Creed, and Problems Within.

![Pasmanda Muslims are a group of socially, educationally, and economically backward Muslims in India,](https://i.ibb.co/RTvwfZfw/ajlaf-muslims-in-india.jpg)

The "Muslim community" is not a single unified group. It is divided very deeply by caste, class, and sect, which is an internal aspect that makes the complexity of the story of the community's marginalization even greater.The OBC Muslim movements, representing the "marginalized" (OBCs and others) Muslims, highlights a long-standing internal oppression by the Hinduised Caste System in Muslim Society, in a Very Small Level it is like Hindu Caste system or Varna mostly in Villages and Outer areas but do exist


OBC Muslim activists argue that they face a triple-layered discrimination: as Muslims (from the Hindu majority), as "low-caste" (from the Muslim elite), and as a backward class (from the state). They have historically been underrepresented within Muslim leadership itself, which has often focused on issues of identity (like personal law) rather than the "bread and butter" issues of development and social justice that disproportionately affect the Pasmanda majority.

## 9. Psychological Trauma and Perpetual Insecurity.

![Discriminatory laws against Muslims in India.](https://i.ibb.co/v4bzV7MD/IMG-Bulldozer-action-aga-2-1-6-BDBAFNL.jpg)

The cumulative effect of this multi-pronged marginalization is a deep and abiding psychological trauma. It is the trauma of living in a state of perpetual insecurity—fear of a mob, fear of a police officers who are under political influence or used as tools by the politicians, fear of a discriminatory law, and fear of an indifferent justice system.Such ongoing "low-grade terror" is what keeps the whole community in a defensive position. It makes them less able to express themselves, limits their movement, and gives them a feeling of being second-class citizens which change the relationship between the individual and the state fundamentally. All of that rubbish is piling up on the Muslims' minds thus having a negative effect on their overall ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌growth.

## 10.‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Pathways to Inclusion.

![Struggle, legal resistance, reform, and solidarity within the Muslim community are essential to strengthen the support for our political leaders.](https://i.ibb.co/YFKT2ZYX/1761813587589389042-0c9ddfe9-a582-4019-9fc1-8b307e306635-0.jpg)

Resistance, Reforms, and Solidarity

Even though the future looks pretty grim, there are still ways of inclusion that are being developed.

Legal Resistance: Challenges to the constitutionality of the CAA and the Supreme Court have been initiated regarding the most discriminatory laws. Civil society groups and legal activists are constantly on the move to record the abuses and demand justice. If I were you, I would not drop my hopes and always be in the struggle for a better political environment in the country you love.

Internal Reform: The uprising of the OBC Muslim movement as the most significant mode of internal resistance, is a story that the community not only demands power and resources but also turns its attention to education, social justice, and economic rights."

Civil Society Solidarity: The ubiquitous, Muslim-led demonstrations against the CAA-NRC, with Shaheen Bagh as the mainstay, were a powerful re-assertion of citizenship and a reclaiming of constitutional values. The protestors received from different groups a significant though fragile cross-community solidarity.Country's other Minorities like Sikh, Christians, Baudhists also support Muslims and oppos the combo of CAA-NRC

True inclusion, however, requires systemic reform. It demands the implementation of the Sachar Committee's recommendation for an Equal Opportunity Commission to counter systemic discrimination. It requires political parties, including secular opposition, to move beyond tokenism and actively field and support Muslim leaders. Finally, it requires the Hindu majority to introspect and actively challenge the majoritarian ideology that threatens to unravel India's pluralistic fabric, recognizing that the suppression of one community is ultimately a suppression of the nation's democratic soul.
