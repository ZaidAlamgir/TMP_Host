After​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ achieving a disruption in the drone industry by Baykar, Selçuk Bayraktar, Fergani Space Technologies whose CEO is has added another feather to the space cap of Türkiye by its second satellite launch fully made in Türkiye.

The 104-kilogram satellite was launched to a low Earth orbit of 510 kilometers with the help of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and it is a giant leap for the establishment of Uluğ Bey, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) of Türkiye , the national equivalent of U.S. GPS, Russia’s GLONASS, China’s BeiDou, and the European Union’s Galileo.

This is an accomplishment that has moved the technology frontier for Türkiye and at the same time has demonstrated its increasing capability of space systems engineering and operations independently. Fergani’s triumph reflects the country’s move to lower the risk of dependence on foreign sources in the most sensitive technological areas while at the same time furthering domestic innovation in aerospace and satellite infrastructure.

Fergani boasts of 135 engineers who are devoted to advanced research and are productive in small satellite design, orbital transfer vehicles, and local launch systems. The company plans to send up more than 100 satellites in the next five years thus creating the core of the Turkish navigation and communication network which will be self-sufficient in terms of security.

The Uluğ Bey GNSS will be a secure, very accurate, and fast way of obtaining the position and time data which are base requirements for the defense of the country, transportation, telecommunications, and scientific research. Its execution is a step forward to Turkey National Space Program that pictures the country as a tech leader in the space sector region-wise and a premier player in global space exploration.

Türkiye is not only technologically on the ascendant by achieving absolute command over its satellite and navigation systems it is also contributing to the consolidation of its strategic independence in the most crucial area of the 21st century: ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌space.
