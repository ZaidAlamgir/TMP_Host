South‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Korea is negotiating a $15 billion defense deal with the United Arab Emirates which includes co-development and possible procurement of the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet. The UAE's search for new options after their long-stalled attempts to acquire the U.S. F-35 and the absence of viable alternatives (such as the Russia's Su-57E, which has seen only a limited number of exports) is the reason for the talks.

 The KF-21, made by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), is a 4.5-generation multirole fighter planned to be eventually fitted with advanced stealth features. The aircraft is an excellent platform for the UAE as it comes politically clean and free of typical Western-style export restrictions. The Emiratis are apparently not only in buying the aircraft but also in the co-development, production, and modification of the jet to their operational requirements.

Such a large-scale transaction would be one of South Korea's biggest defense exports, thus, the KF-21 program will be benefited with more significant economies of scale and Seoul's position as a new global arms supplier will be enhanced. The agreement can involve collaboration in the manufacturing process, a technology exchange, and the cooperation for maintenance and support in the long run.

On the other hand, collaborating with South Korea allows the UAE to deflect from the heavy reliance on U.S. approvals for cutting-edge systems while increasing its arsenal partners. Besides, it is in line with the UAE's strategic plan to broaden its local defense production and to become involved in more of the high-tech aerospace sectors.

International analysts are keeping an eye on the negotiations because of the possible strategic effects. Among other things, a big UAE-South Korea alliance could change regional military dynamics, affect future fighter-jet competitions, and increase the standing of South Korea as a serious player in the global defence ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌markets.
