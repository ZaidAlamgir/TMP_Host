In​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ an effort to try to rid the world of the problem of Boko Haram, Donald Trump threatened to "go into" Nigeria "guns-a-blazing" to wipe out the extremists who are committing horrible atrocities against the Christian population of the country. The US president said he had ordered the Pentagon to prepare for a possible action, assuring that the U.S. attack would be fast, vicious, and sweet. 

According to Washington, Christians who constitute almost half of Nigeria’s population  have been killed, kidnapped, and terrorized for years by armed groups in the country’s north. On the surface, Trump’s declaration might appear to be a moral stance against the violence and instability affecting civilian communities.

However, the African Union and other regional groups have tried to dispel such a Washington-originated narrative. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) released a communiqué denying accusations of a deliberate campaign targeting Christians in Nigeria and warning that such allegations have the potential to spark conflicts in the region.

> "Genocide claims concerning Christians in Nigeria are false and only serve to increase the regional tensions. ECOWAS vehemently repudiates these fabricated and perilous statements that destabilize the security of communities and weaken social cohesion in the region," the bloc said.

Regarding the question of timing, analysts also doubt Trump's threat. The terrorists mentioned have been around since the first decade of the 2000s, and Nigeria's sectarian strife has its roots in the country's separation from Great Britain in 1960 — the colonial "divide and rule" method that not only divided the country along ethnic but also religious lines. So why is the U.S. merely now indicating the possible use of force?

According to the reason that may be given by Nigeria's enormous mineral wealth, the West African superpower is home to valuable reserves:

Oil: over 37 billion barrels (~$3 trillion value)

Natural gas: over 210 trillion cubic feet (~$1 trillion value)

Bitumen: 42 billion tons — the world's second-largest reserves (~$500 billion+)

Iron ore: 3 billion tons (~$300 billion)

Bauxite: as much as 2 billion tons (~$100 billion+)

Lithium: recently discovered deposits (2018, 2022) — two Chinese-funded processing plants opened this year

Zinc, tin, copper, gold, and diamonds worth hundreds of billions more

These commodities, most notably lithium and bauxite, are the lifeblood of the global tech and defense sectors, which in turn are the main consumers of the products that utilize these commodities, such as smartphones and electric cars to sophisticated missile systems.

Just before Trump made his remarks, the Brookings Institution, a leading Washington think tank, advised African countries to work together more closely with the U.S. in developing critical mineral supply chains. Nigeria was recognized for its beryllium, zircon, tin, and zinc reserves and praised for making "significant progress" in governance reforms conducive to U.S. partnerships.

Within a month of that report, the tone of President Trump's utterances morphed into one of a looming military intervention — presumably to quell the violence and protect the innocent, yet contradictory as a mineral security strategy potential pillar nation.

Opponents maintain that the US government's depiction of intervention as benevolent or anti-terrorism initiatives is a façade that conceals deeper economic or strategic motives  a pattern already evident in oil or rare earth-rich areas. On the contrary, Trump's supporters argue that he is the one who is taking the helm decisively when the previous administrations were dithering.

Whatever the reality may be, one thing stands out – Nigeria has become a new battleground in the worldwide race for the resources that will fuel the 21st century. Also, with President Trump's renewed "America First" policy, the boundary between saving the people and acquiring minerals may become so faint that it will be hard to tell one from the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌other.
