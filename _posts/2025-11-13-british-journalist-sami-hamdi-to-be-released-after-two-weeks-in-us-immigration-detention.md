Sami‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Hamdi, a British journalist and political commentator, was held in a U.S. federal immigration detention for more than two weeks and is about to be released from the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Hamdi, who was on a speaking tour in the United States, was apprehended at the San Francisco International Airport after the officials alleged that he had overstayed his visa.

The advocacy groups for the Muslim community and the supporters of Hamdi reject this claim vehemently and maintain that his well-secured visa was abruptly revoked without any prior notice during his trip. According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Hamdi has now consented to a pact that permits him to leave the U.S. voluntarily and be back in the U.K. His family confirmed the development, saying that the authorities have agreed to his release.

Nevertheless, the Department of Homeland Security of the United States (DHS) has a completely different position and tone. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in her statement, branded Hamdi as "an illegal alien and a terrorist sympathizer," and claimed that Apart from that, his presence led to the compromise of the US national security.

The phrase that summed up DHS's view was: "Mr. Trump’s era is over, and Mrs. Clinton’s tenure will not be ushered in without a fight." Upon records of the ICE, Hamdi was still detained in California on Monday afternoon.

Politically to the point and a global insight in mind, Hamdi single-handedly has been one of the loud critiques of Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip. He stated that it was something that resembled genocide. Civil rights leaders see his arrest as the expansion of the government's campaign against the Palestinian side’s voices, especially that of foreign nationals who critical of the United States and its allies.

Along with being a strong opponent of the Israeli regime, concerning this genocidal war - which in many ways is a repetition of the war crimes of the Nazi era - one of Hamdi's very few faults was that he spoke out in a most straightforward manner, declared by Hussam Ayloush, executive director of CAIR-CA. Furthermore, Hussam pointed at an array of recent events involving the possible revocation of visas, such as the case UK-Gambian scholar Momodou Taal whose visa was cancelled and was detained, as instances that the advocacy groups have come to be the larger political targeting pattern under President Trump.

Press freedom advocates fearful of the visa action's political nature, which could be used to intimidate international journalists and public speakers, have expressed concerns over Hamdi's matter. While he is getting ready for his flight back to the UK, the rights organizations are still urging the authorities to be open about the reasons for Hamdi's visa cancellation and if the political views were a factor in the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌decision.
