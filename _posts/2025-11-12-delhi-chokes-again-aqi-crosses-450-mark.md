For‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the second day in a row, Delhi woke up to a thick and toxic haze, with the air quality still being in the "severe" category. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed that the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was just short of 460 which is four times the safe limit of 50. Air was declared unfit not only for people with existing health conditions but also for healthy individuals.

Pollution experts state that such a continuous smog situation cannot be solved unless a deadly mixture of factors that include the stubble burning, emissions from vehicles, pollution from industries, and bad weather that traps the pollutants is dispelled. Besides, the visibility in most of the region of the capital including the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Connaught Place, and Noida expressway halved during the morning time.

People living in Delhi-NCR widely reported that their eyes were burning, their throats were irritated, and they were having breathing problems. The demand for medical care has gone up due to respiratory ailments, especially among children and aged people, hospitals have said.

"It is a winter story every time. We cannot go out without masks and even inside the house, it is hard to breathe," expressed Ritika Sharma from East Delhi.

SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) data provides evidence that the amount of PM2.5, that is small particles that can reach the lungs and blood vessels was more than eight times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Delhi government has brought back Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) after the air quality has turned worse. The measures under the plan include stopping the construction and demolition works (except for essential ones), closing schools till Class V in some districts, advising government employees to work from home, and prohibiting diesel trucks other than those carrying essential commodities.

Besides that, The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) wrote to Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, asking them to intensify their fight against the stubble burning. The letter reads that the practice has risen alarmingly during the last week.

The prolonged exposure to these extremely high levels of pollution may lead to an increase in chronic respiratory diseases, heart problems, and diminished lung capacity among people living in Delhi, according to environment experts.

Delhi’s pollution problem is no longer seasonal. Instead, it is structural, explained Dr. Randeep Guleria, ex-director of AIIMS. “Without seeing collaboration between the states during the whole year and strict enforcement of emission controls, these incidents will keep happening.”

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts that there will be weak winds and low temperatures in the next few days. Such weather may deteriorate the air quality further. They will clear the pollutants only if there are strong northwesterly winds later this week.

Citizens, on the other hand, are urged to refrain from outdoor strenuous activities, wear N95 masks, keep their windows shut, and use air purifiers wherever they can.

The air emergency in Delhi is yet another instance that has thrown open the question of necessity of a comprehensive year-round strategy which includes stricter emission norms, reforms in urban planning, and co-operation between states. The national capital without diligent work runs the risk of becoming a gas chamber every winter and thus threatening the lives of millions and public health ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌system.
