2nd Islamic Summit Conference held in Lahore, Pakistan in February 1974, was a landmark event that saw the congregation of the mightiest Muslim leaders of the time, the Islamic world. The man-made and natural disasters of the African continent, the wars in the Middle East, and the turmoil in South Asia attracted the attention of the world's political elite, and together with the revolutionary zeal of their followers, they marched towards a brighter future of united Muslim world, Palestine-front, independent political and economic forces free of the West most eagerly. Despite the fact that in less than ten years majority of the people who hugged each other at this summit were forcibly removed, killed or died in veiled circumstances.

The Lahore Summit was a grasping moment. It not only made the Muslim world more united through the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) but also the idea of sharing economic ventures and speaking in one voice globally magazine topics were born there. However, the next decades peeled off their façade to reveal that these proud and defiant states were bleeding from within and beset by enemies outside.

The host country Pakistan was left with political upheaval following the events of the summit. In the power struggle between the army and democratically elected administrations dominated Pakistan's political landscape the military intervention became the hallmark. The deposition of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by the military coup orchestrated by General Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 betrayed the clash of rival institutions at the very heart of the country. The endless round of clashes between civilian and military authorities that followed has been a major stumbling block in Pakistan’s political and economic progress since then.

King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, whose brilliant idea was the oil embargo against the West that caused the energy crisis of 1973, was shot dead in 1975. The Islamic economic cooperation and the introduction of a common currency for the Muslim world underlined his efforts to put a new spin on the existing power relations. It was upon Faisal's passing that his country's unexpectedly active policy faced an abrupt and quiet intermission.

Bangladesh's Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the architect of the country's cooperation with the Arab world, was murdered along with his family in 1975. As a result of his death, a political upheaval ensued which pulled Bangladesh closer to the West and which in turn marginalized the Muslim collaboration Mujib had championed.

Gaddafi stuck to his guns with radical Islamic and Pan-Africanist rhetoric for many years. He envisioned and pushed for a 'United States of Islam' and later on, suggested a gold-backed dinar to replace the dollar in inter-Muslim trade. The end of his reign and his subsequent murder during a NATO operation in 2011 was a metaphor not only for the overthrow of a regime but also for the disappearance of a leader who saw the way to set the Global South free financially.

Lahore Summit was also graced by the presence of Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. He passed away in 2004 in quite mysterious circumstances and it was later rumoured that he was the victim of radioactive poisoning. After him, the Palestinian problem became the most dispersed and destabilized faction in the Middle East without a leader to rally round.

Sadat of Egypt, who had fought against Israel in 1973 and was initially a proponent of pan-Arab unity, later on signed the Camp David Accords which formally acknowledged Israel in 1978. The killing of this Egyptian president by radicals in 1981 signified, among other things, the withdrawal of Egypt from the forefront of Arab nationalism.

The demise and failure of these stalwarts spanning from the Maghreb to the Indian subcontinent formed not only a geographical but also a metaphorical arc , the very "crescent" that once was the bedrock of Muslim solidarity and which thus became the ground for their downfall. Apart from the external conspiracies the rapid disintegration of the dream hinged heavily on the internal schisms, the power struggles, and the reliance on foreign protagonists.

The 1974 Lahore Summit is often seen as that fleeting moment in the history of Muslim nations when they seemed to be united in their objectives. Later came the decades of disunion, political instability, and squandered potentials. The dreams of that generation dissipated, leaving behind lessons about how without unity even the most ambitious plans are vulnerable to be torn down by internal strife and external ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌machinations.
