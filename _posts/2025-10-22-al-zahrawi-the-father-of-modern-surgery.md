Al-Zahrawi is one of those people, or maybe the single one, who can be called the father of modern surgery by history itself, not any lesser authority. For a long time, his work called Al-Tasrif was the handbook that every surgeon looked up to.

Al-Zahrawi not only thought of but also introduced to the world surgical instruments more than 200 different kinds, and parts of those devices are still being used, in one way or another, today. The methods he invented for stitching wounds, removing stones, and performing delicate surgical operations were centuries ahead of Europe.

Al-Zahrawi was very accurate and he loved people, which really made him different from the others. To operate, he said, the surgeon must be skilled, patient, and make the patient feel comfortable. Actually, by noticing the details, he was the first one to realize that those details formed the scientific side and hence made surgery a science.

For very long periods of time, European medical schools based their teaching of surgery on the Latin versions of his works that were considered his classic works in the field. His work is still there in the background of every single operating theatre, saying: "Without the Muslim scholar from the Middle Ages Spain, the miracle of modern surgery would not be possible".

Many years later, Al-Zahrawi’s impact is still resonating in the corridors of present-day medicine. Every operation done successfully, every surgeon who is careful, and every life that is saved by surgical skill are the things that are to a small extent Al-Zahrawi’s legacy — the brilliance of a Muslim scholar who forever changed the course of healing is a testament.
