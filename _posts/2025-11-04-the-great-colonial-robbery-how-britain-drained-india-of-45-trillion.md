Before‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the British came, India was one of the richest and most industrially advanced civilizations in the world. The world was mesmerized by the Indian fine muslins of Bengal and the renowned wootz steel of South India. Indian crafts and industries were the talk of the world and were exchanged with various continents. India was almost the source of 1/4 of the world's GDP and was a pioneering hub for the production of textiles, steelmaking, shipbuilding, and handicrafts. However, at the time of the British departure, India’s share had dropped to only 3%. The country that once showcased its manufacturing prowess had been turned into a mere exporter of raw materials and buyer of British finished goods.

This change was not the outcome of India's natural decline or competition; rather, it was a conspicuous economic move. Britain carried out an economic war against India that, although kept under wraps, was very harsh in nature, with the consequence that Indian industries were broken down to supply the British industrial revolution.

The drastic turn came after the Battle of Plassey (1757), the EIC took over Bengal. India’s richest province, which was blessed with fertile land and was highly populated, was thus controlled. Having seized power, the Company first off put Indian commerce under its control by installing restrictions and tariffs that suffocated the native business. Indian textiles that had a major share in worldwide markets were forced to pay customs dues as high as 70-80% to gain access to the British market. At the same time, British products made in factories were shipped to India without any tax, thus local consumers getting goods at a cheaper rate and tricking Indian producers into losing their markets.

No traditional industry would be able to endure such unfair trading conditions. Indian weavers were experts but their products had clothed Europe; didn't it make sense then that their incomes were cut off? What is worse is that Britain officials went as far as taking the looms and preventing the craftsman from working by cutting their thumbs thus doing away with the competition. The farmers are said to have been forced to cultivate cash crops like indigo, cotton, and opium at the expense of food grains, thus leaving hundreds of thousands exposed to the risks of famine and poverty.

While the Industrial Revolution was starting in Britain, India became its economic fuel. The colonial rulers exploited India's wealth through a set of unjust taxes, monopoly in trade, and ill-managed exchange rates. Indian money was used for British wars, infrastructures, and the making of London as the leading imperial city. Dadabhai Naoroji, one of India's first economic thinkers, called this process the "Drain of Wealth.” This gradual “drain of wealth” is believed to have been almost $45 trillion (in current value) over the period 1765 to 1938, a process that economists and historians describe as a significant factor behind Britain's industrialization and India's subsequent impoverishment.

From the 18th century up to the 19th century, the British extracted money and wealth from India, which would have been worth trillions if calculated today, to feed their economy. The effects of it were terrible - India’s per capita income had no growth, rural areas were in bad shape, and whole villages had been pushed into extreme poverty.

Brits through many propaganda methods tried to convince the colonized people of India, that they were doing the colony a great favor by civilizing them. They gained a lot of support with the building of railways, telegraphs, and ports which were taken as proofs of progress. Still, these were the measures of an empire, not a colony. These projects were aimed at making the empire more efficient in getting the resources it needed, moving the troops it needed to make its hold, and generally facilitating what it was up to - resource extraction. Railways, which were the result of Indian taxpayers’ money, were used to make profits by the British thus increasing the economic dependency.

India was left reeling economically due to 200 years of deliberate exploitation when it was separated from the UK in 1947. Its industrial base was wiped out, agricultural sector was despoiled, and the country had one of the lowest rates in the world in literacy and life expectancy. The new nation's leaders, especially Jawaharlal Nehru, were aware of the enormity of the catastrophe. The emphasis on self-reliance in India after independence through the Five-Year Plans, public sector enterprises, and the safeguarding of local production was a colonial-era inspired reaction.

Present-day India’s movement toward economic self-sufficiency, through programs such as Atmanirbhar Bharat, is still drawing from that same historical determination to recreate what was taken apart on purpose.

Brite’s economic war against India was not conducted with rifles and bombs but with trade laws, taxes and monopolies. It was one of the most methodical, historic, economically exploitative acts, in history. The story of declining Indian industry during the colonial period is not only a tale of the riches that were lost; it is about the forcible reshaping of a civilization to serve the empire of another.

However, as a result, the account teaches a lesson in the indomitable spirit of the people. India has made a comeback and is now more resolute than ever in her quest for economic freedom and her return to her pre-industrial prowess. The current Indian dream - of revolution in technology, and the revival of the self-sufficiency model through the local production of goods - is not new. In fact, it is very much the reawakening of the very model that used to be the pride of the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌world.
