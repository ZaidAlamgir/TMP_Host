Pavel‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Durov, founder of Telegram, at the Blockchain Life 2025 conference, launched a new decentralized platform named Confidential Compute Open Network (Cocoon). The stated goal of the project is to change the AI computing environment by combining artificial intelligence, social media, and Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain in a single ecosystem.

Cocoon intends to revolutionize the field of AI computing to be more affordable, secure, and accessible. Durov claims that the key objective of the platform is to lessen the high cost of AI tools like text generation, summarization, and model training and at the same time ensure the privacy of user data — a problem that has been increasingly dominant in the tech sector with centralization of power.

The most futuristic idea behind Cocoon is probably its decentralized GPU-sharing model. The owners of graphics processing units (GPUs) can make their idle computing power available to the Cocoon network and get back some TON tokens. This incentive mechanism built on the blockchain not only makes the users happy with their rewards but also accelerates the creation of a distributed network that can handle large-scale AI computation without the need for corporate data centers.

Developers of AI models will find in Cocoon a new resource to obtain the necessary computing power for the training and deployment of their models at a low cost and with assured privacy. The developers will be allowed to connect to the Cocoon network and use the shared computational power directly from the global participants, thus, it will be possible to do away with the large centralized providers who come with high fees and sometimes, data security risks.

Durov noted that the system would provide confidential computing capabilities, essentially, AI operations, as well as sensitive data, would be safe from any external sources. This move is entirely in line with his continued support for digital privacy and decentralization, which are not only the major aspects of his advocacy but also have substantially influenced Telegram's development over the years.

In October, Durov announced the opening of an AI laboratory in Kazakhstan focused on combining blockchain technology with neural networks. This lab is expected to be the main driver behind the technological advancement of Cocoon and the realization of a secure, transparent, and decentralized AI infrastructure.

By Cocoon, Durov is trying to break the stronghold of the few tech giants on the AI market and provide a user-centric and developer-friendly community model as an alternative.

In a scenario where they succeed, the role of AI to the development and deployment of technologies can be changed radically by the introduction of Cocoon — a new decentralized intelligence era that operates on openness, collaboration, and privacy rather than the control of central ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌powers.
