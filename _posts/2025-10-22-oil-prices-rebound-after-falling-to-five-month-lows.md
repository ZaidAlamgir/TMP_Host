Global oil markets enjoying slight recovery on Tuesday. Prices bounced from five-month lows personally fell, though sentiment remains overall bearish. Brent crude futures added 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $61.15 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for November delivery—which expires today—added 8 cents, or 0.1% to settle at $57.60 

The earnings came after a drastic decline had occurred the previous market week, with both benchmarks reaching their five-month low for the week. Analysts suggest that the weakness stems collectively from record U.S. oil production and OPEC sticking to its scheduled increases in output. This has intensified concerns about a growing global supply glut due to uncertainty surrounding demand forecasts and slow economic growth, while also considering geopolitical risk. 

Market players have even reported that traders have become increasingly cautious over the risk of oversupply while oil inventories in the previous week continued increasing in many of the biggest economies. For some investors, the recent dip was viewed as a technical correction of oil prices. This might suggest that prices will linger at these levels until traders digest the most recent production numbers.
 
So, oil prices were under pressure on Tuesday, despite the modest recovery in market prices. The fundamentals remain tilted toward a fragile balance between supply and demand over the coming months.
