In​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ a historic step that signifies the most major change to the German defense policy after more than ten years, the ruling SPD–CDU/CSU coalition has given the green light to a hybrid military service scheme that merges voluntary enlistment with potential selective conscription. The reform, which is intended to bolster the Bundeswehr's human resources and operational readiness, is scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2026.

According to the new system, all 18-year-old men born from 2008 will have to undergo mandatory fitness and willingness tests in which they will be evaluated for their suitability and interest in the military service. Even though the plan is mainly based on voluntary recruitment, the government still keeps the possibility of implementing a selective conscription by way of a lottery if the number of newly enlisted people is too low to meet the targets.

The Bundeswehr’s new goals for its personnel are pretty high, they want to have 255,000 to 270,000 soldiers on active duty and a further 200,000 in the reserve. Those who choose to serve will be paid €2,600 per month and will be provided with training and an attractive benefits package that will make the job offer appealing to the qualified people.

It is worth mentioning that if the fitness tests are compulsory only for males, then females will have the opportunity to register for service voluntarily thus maintaining Germany’s pledge for equal rights in the military.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius explained that the hybrid system is a sensible compromise between civic duty and personal freedom. “Germany has to be able to defend itself and at the same time help NATO with its collective security,” he pointed out, expressing the concern that Europe is becoming less secure due to the tension with Russia and the instability of the neighboring regions.

## European Reactions

Germany’s decision has been the talk and the critique of the entire continent.

France was supportive of the decision, with the French authorities stating that the change in policy “accurately matches Europe’s security challenges.” French defense experts saw similarities in the French model when it comes to the increasing role of the reservists and youth programs.

Poland that shares a border not only with Germany but with different parts of Ukraine affected by war, had only praise for Berlin’s move calling it “a positive step” toward strengthening NATO’s eastern flank. Warsaw invited other Western European countries to join in the effort to establish a resilient continental defense stance.

The two countries with compulsory military service, Sweden and Finland, regarded the German plan as “a fair and essential update.” Observers from the Nordic region argued that the German system could become a link between the fully conscripted and the voluntary professional armies, which are prevalent in Western Europe.

Austria and the Netherlands, on the other hand, were worried about the possible emergence of the political and administrative issues resulting from the plan. Members of the Dutch parliament expressed concern that putting the pieces of the conscription puzzle back together could spark renewed discussions among citizens over their rights and government control.

Among NATO members, the initiative has been welcomed albeit with some reservations. Officials from the Alliance, while talking off the record, characterized Germany’s step as “long overdue” and see it as indicative of a broader trend of European countries gradually returning to deterrent capabilities in response to the most unstable security situation since the Cold War.

## A New Chapter for the Bundeswehr

Germany's mixed system, which will be realized in 2026, is going to be a turning point for the Bundeswehr , a chapter where the storyline entails a harmonious blend of voluntary service, the possible readiness and the strategic flexibility. By giving back to the people the option of serving their country while at the same time allowing for democratic choice, Berlin is very likely to succeed in keeping its armed forces not only strong but also responsible in today's world of ever-changing political ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌conflicts.
