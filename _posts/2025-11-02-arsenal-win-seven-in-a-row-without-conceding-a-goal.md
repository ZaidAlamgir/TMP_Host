Arsenal are playing breathtaking football, a fact which has left both the Gunners' supporters and rivals amazed. In the last seven games that Arsenal have played in various competitions, the team from north London have managed to keep a clean sheet and have recorded seven consecutive wins while netting 14 times.

On the face of it, this epic run is a testimony to the perfect balance of a tight defense and a potent attack. Arsenal under Mikel Arteta have become a team that controls the game with the ball and yet are very difficult to break down. The two central defenders William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães have been instrumental in this turnaround while, as usual, goalkeeper David Raya has hardly needed to intervene because of the team’s overall defensive work.

In attack, Arsenal's front line have got the mojo back with them. The trio of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, and Martin Ødegaard have mixed inventiveness with ruthless finishing in such a way that Arsenal not only dominate the matches but are also the ones to execute them.

As a result of such steady performances, the fans have been restored with the conviction that Arsenal are real treasure hunters this season. What is more, their ability to stifle the opponents’ game and at the same time keep the attacking pressure shows growth a very important characteristic of a team, which is embarking on a multi-front challenge.

Arsenal might be able to turn their project of chasing the title into one of dominating the league if they continue playing at this level. Seven matches, seven victories and no goals conceded  it is not just good form; it is a declaration.
