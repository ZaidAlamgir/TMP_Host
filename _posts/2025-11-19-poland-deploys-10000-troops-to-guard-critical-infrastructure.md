Poland‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ indicated that it is going to deploy 10,000 soldiers to guard vital facilities spread all over the country with the main emphasis on railway networks, energy sources, and other areas of the installation. The decision was made in response to the detonations of a rail line in the east of Poland, in which local authorities suspect it to be an intentional act, and the source of operations is Russia.

Officials report that this change is one of an extended security program that is planned to be carried out to counter hybrid threats. Poland's railways are not only of significant importance to the country, but also serve as a primary transit route, through which military and humanitarian supplies can be transported to Ukraine. The incident caused the concern of the security of the roads and the danger of the lines' interruption supporting NATO.

Minister of Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz assured that the military will have a joint operation with the police, border guards, and intelligence agencies informed of cooperation and providing security at different levels in the different layers in their different responsibilities and at different locations. The railway blast was defined as an "action of state terrorism" by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who also forecasted that Poland will have to face a higher threat level and therefore ought to react firmly.

The injection of troops to the area, in their view, is a sign that Poland will not hesitate to escalate the war by considering the security of the infrastructures as one of the essentials of national defense. The measure taken by a country on a border may be followed by a country on each side of a border if the neighbours think that there is a risk of their country being involved in the events caused by safety and security issues, in particular, if in the continent there is a rise of concerns over sabotage, cyberattacks, and other strategies aiming at destabilization.

That plan will be in action shortly, with soldiers deployed at key points of the railways, energy sectors, and transport corridors connecting the frontiers. Poland realizes that it is faced with a demanding security environment and, therefore, it has decided to increase its inspections and surveillance, as well as quickly responding to any ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌incident.
