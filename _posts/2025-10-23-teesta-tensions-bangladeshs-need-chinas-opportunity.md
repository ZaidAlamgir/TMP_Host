With the Teesta River flowing through India’s Sikkim and West Bengal and then entering northern Bangladesh, it is indeed one of the most contested water sources in South Asia. It spans over approximately 414 kilometers and is a source of life for millions of people who use it for agriculture, irrigation, and fishing. But the absence of a joint water-sharing pact between India and Bangladesh has transformed the Tista River into a symbol of regional mistrust and now a platform for China's rising influence.

## Why Bangladesh Needs Teesta Water

The Tista River is a lifeline for almost 21 million people in the northern districts of Bangladesh such as Rangpur, Nilphamari, and Gaibandha. More than 750,000 hectares of land are irrigated by the river, which is mostly used for rice cultivation during the dry "boro" season. But the river’s flow gets to drop very drastically in the lean months (December–April) - from 5,000 cusecs of water required it drops to barely 1,200–1,500 cusecs and some days it even goes below 300 cusecs.

The deficiency of the river cuts large farming areas that are left dry and growers have to utilize groundwater or altogether stop farming. The consequences are reduced agricultural productivity, seasonal migration, and rise in discontent in an already impoverished region. For many years, Dhaka has been calling for a fair and regular share of the Tista water based on global standards for transboundary rivers.

In 2011, both countries were close to signing a pact that would allocate 42.5% of the dry-season flow to India and 37.5% to Bangladesh. The agreement was scrapped, however, due to protest by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claiming that sharing Teesta waters would put irrigation and drinking water supply in North Bengal at risk. As a result of this opposition at the state level, the wait for the Teesta water sharing agreement has been extended, leaving Bangladesh disappointed and actively seeking a new partner.

## How China Gains from the Teesta Dispute

After the deadlock in the Indo-Bangladesh talks, China came to take the place vacated by the others. Beijing injected a proposal to the tune of close to USD 1 billion in 2020 to cover the expenses of the “Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project.” The program that included dredging, embankment construction, and flood control endeavors was set up to eventually bring about flow stabilization in Bangladesh’s Teesta basin.

This engagement with China would definitely bring Bangladesh’s dream of modern water structures to life while freeing it from the Indian hold. However, the good that China gets out of it is more of a strategic nature. The area of the project is not more than 100 kilometers away from the Siliguri Corridor of India, which is the narrow “chicken neck” that connects the Indian mainland to its northeastern states. With the help of the investment in Bangladesh’s Teesta region, Beijing not only enhances its position in South Asia but also acquires influence over a region that is vital for India's national security.

Also, the presence of China in the area aligns with its broader Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan, through which it is able to extend its influence in South Asia with a combination of loans and infrastructure development. Eager for investment and impatient with India’s delaying tactics, Dhaka has been very welcoming of the Chinese moves. While critics warn of long-term strategic and financial risks, the city of Dhaka is certainly welcoming the participation of the Chinese in its development projects.

## Why India Should Worry

India held back from sharing Teesta water which has had serious geopolitical implications now. The infrastructure supported by the Chinese funds near the Siliguri Corridor can be a dual-use facility – on the surface, it may be for peaceful purposes but it can also help intelligence or surveillance operations. What’s more, the Dhaka’s tilt more towards Beijing can result in a weak "Neighbourhood First" policy by India which in turn means less diplomatic leverage for India in South Asia.

On the home front, India’s failure to harmonize the federal and national interests—between New Delhi’s foreign policy objectives and West Bengal’s concerns regarding water—has revealed its structural deficiency. If the matter stays unsettled, it may lead to the in-depth cooperation of Bangladesh with China which in turn may result in a gradual diminishment of India’s presence in its immediate vicinity.

Wrapping Up

The Teesta impasse is not just about water anymore - it's about the regional power balance. On one hand, Bangladesh is seeking justice, on the other hand, China is taking advantage of the situation, while India is under pressure to show leadership. The river, which was once the vehicle of cooperation, may soon flow as a reminder of lost trust and shifting power in South Asia unless New Delhi moves quickly to finalize a fair water-sharing ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌deal.
