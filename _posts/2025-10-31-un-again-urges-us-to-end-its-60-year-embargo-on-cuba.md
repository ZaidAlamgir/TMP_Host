Once‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ again, for the 33rd year in a row, the United Nations General Assembly has, by a very large majority, voted to require the end of the economic embargo that the US has been maintaining against Cuba for the last 60 years or so. Thus, the global community continues to be against Washington’s policy.

The embargo on Cuba was supported by 165 out of 193 UN member countries, with 7 opposing it, and 12 abstaining. In particular, Aside from the USA and a few other countries, Argentina, Ukraine, and Hungary also opposed the resolution. This is a significant change compared to last year when only the US and Israel voted against the resolution, and the vote count was 187-2.

The island state referred to the embargo as a "policy of collective punishment" that denies the basic rights of the people. More than 60 years of these measures have dealt a severe blow to the island's economy, imposing strict limitations on its participation in trade, investment, and global finance, and resulting in the shortage of all kinds of necessities such as food, fuel, and medicines.

There are numerous commentators asserting that what the government in Washington says about it being the protector of democracy and human rights is just a facade. While the US claims the sanctions as a response to human rights violations, it is, however, responsible for a series of costly military interventions that have caused the death of innocent people in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. To watchdogs, it is a paradoxical act for a country that is the top non-proliferator of bombs on civilian populations to pose as their global human rights protector.

Critics also argue that support for Cuba this year has been decreased due to the reasons other than principles, such as economic and political dependencies. The Argentine rescue program, which includes US-backed financial assistance of nearly $20 billion, has made Buenos Aires more dependent on Washington's goodwill. On the other hand, Ukraine's decision to side with the US is due to its dependence on the American aid, which is the only way it can defend against the Russian invasion that is still going on. Also, Hungary has become more close to Washington as the European power dynamics have been changing.

Though the UN vote does not have any legal power, the message conveyed is still the same: the whole world is pretty much against the embargo which they see as a leftover from the times of the Cold War. However, as long as the US politics at home keep the sanctions going, the question of how Cuba can continue its fight against economic isolation will be still there along with the question about Washington's global credibility in the area of human ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌rights.
