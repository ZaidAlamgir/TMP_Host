For‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ a long time, Venezuela has been at the center of Washington's foreign policy focus - not because of the alleged concern for "democracy" or "human rights," but rather due to its massive oil wealth and politically independent nature. Being a country which has been heavily dependent on energy imports, the US has always been keen on getting control over or influencing the resource-rich countries. Holding the largest proved oil reserves in the world, Venezuela is both a challenge and a potential of benefit for the U.S. strategic interests in Latin America.

After the death of President Hugo Chávez and with the history of his coming to power in 1999, the way of Venezuela’s economy and politics was changed by him. He took over major industries, used oil money to finance social and welfare activities, and was against any kind of U.S. intervention in the area. The very same deeds made him a champion of fight against the West – yet simultaneously he became the biggest target of the U.S. Under Chávez and after him under Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has turned its back on neoliberalism and chosen to be friends with Russia, China, Iran, and other countries with whom it shares a common view of the world as multipolar.

As a result, the U.S. took various measures in order to isolate Venezuela and bring it down. Sanctions hit hard its oil exports, immobilized vast amounts of money in various banks, and caused terrible shortages. Officials from America loud and clear advocated for a change in the regime, thus recognizing opposition figures as "legitimate" leaders ,which is a breach of international laws. Beneath the façade of "restoring democracy" is the very same well-known strategy that was used in Iraq, Libya, and Syria: create instability, take away legitimacy, and substitute the government that is not compliant with U.S. interests.

The United States has a long and unfortunate history of this kind of craftiness. The Gulf of Tonkin event which was made up to get a reason for the Vietnam War, the bogus allegations of WMD that were used to justify the invasion of Iraq - in fact, most of Washington's moves to intervene have been built on manipulation and misinformation. Similar to these countries before it, Venezuela is being branded as a failed state while its domestic challenges are being played up as a way of sanctioning the involvement of outsiders. The truth, however, is that a significant portion of its problems are the result of economic warfare and diplomatic isolation carried out by the US.

Recently, a rift has been added to the relationship between the US and Venezuela turning the tension more and more towards the point of war. The U.S. Southern Command has added to its monitoring and naval activities in the Caribbean with the number of their operations near Venezuelan waters going up. American forces have also made more efforts in working with Colombia, a great friend of the U.S. and the country where there are many military bases that can be used as strategic places in a possible war.

Venezuela, on the other hand, is not watching quietly. With the help of Russia, China, and Iran, it has modernized its radar networks, missile interceptors, and fighter jetcaps. The Venezuelan army habitually performs combined drills with foreign friends, thereby hinting at their preparedness to oppose any attack on national freedom. Besides helping deter, those maneuvers also prove that the Venezuelan capital is not cut off from the military world any longer.

Such a scenario is at the heart of a larger geopolitical rivalry—the one pitting Washington against the emerging world order that is less dominated and more focused on independence and self-rule. Often America’s talk about “freedom” is merely a facade behind which she seeks to keep her grip on resources and power. Venezuela’s refusal to comply is almost like a thorn in that coat.

The truth is: the U.S. is not scared of the Venezuelan regime, but rather of its independence. The fight is not just about oil or ideology, but should be about the very basic right of the peoples to decide for themselves without conceding to the foreigners. History is full of examples when America’s worst foe was a free and sovereign voice that defied ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌orders.
