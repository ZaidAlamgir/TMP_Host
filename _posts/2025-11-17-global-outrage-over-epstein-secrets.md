Increasing public anger over the lack of consequences for the elite has led to renewed discussions of the Jeffrey Epstein case. This happened after new statements purporting a cover-up of politically and financially powerful people abusing minors were posted online. The debate got hotter when journalist Yunus Paksoy talked about a bunch of emails that Epstein wrote, in which, among other things, he accused Donald Trump.

The verification of the email's origin and their full content has not been done by anyone, but their dissemination has resulted in more people demanding openness and taking responsibility from the government.

## A Public Demanding Answers

People everywhere on social media and in the political arena are saying that the universal human right to safeguard children should be above any party loyalty. A popular Turkish saying whose main idea is children protection is most often used when referring to the spoken words of the case:

“Those who are confident in their ablution will be confident in their prayer.”

Here the proverb is interpreted by most people as a challenge to those leaders who claim to be clean but refuse to be checked.

Advocates argue that all the documents related to Epstein visitor logs, communications, agreements, court files, references to intelligence, sealed testimonies should be made public without any exception, neither of political parties nor of economic status. For them, this is not a matter of the Republicans against the Democrats, the left versus the right, or people versus parties. The children are the issue. The abuse of power is the issue. The elites who possibly have exploited children with the use of their influence and have escaped the justice, are the issue.

## Claims Referencing Trump Raise New Political Questions

The most disputable aspect of these recently shared fragments is about Epstein to have several email mentions of Trump. Some of the words attributed to Epstein are:

“Trump was with the victim for hours in my house.”

“I understand how corrupt Trump is.”

“Trump was aware of the girls.”

“Trump is a dog that doesn’t bark.”

“We will be having Thanksgiving together.”

“I am the only one who is able to bring down Trump.”

“Would you like to have photographs of Trump with girls in bikinis?”

Epstein supposedly said that among the people he met “none were as bad as Trump,” and that “he didn't have one decent cell in his body.”

If these statements are real, then they would be evidence for the opposite of Trump's repeated assertions that he had very few contacts with Epstein and didn’t know anything about his crimes.

While Trump was a candidate, he claimed that he would disclose the names of those to whom Epstein “pimped out underage girls.” Critics say that for the last six months he has been completely silent on the matter of Epstein.

The absence of explanation intensifies the guessing and the anger of the people.

## A Broader, Global Issue: Elite Impunity

Though the latest scandal is about the United States, the people’s ire knows no borders and is worldwide. The Epstein affair is frequently brought up as a typical example of a system that is biased towards the elite, where the trio of power, riches, and political connections supposedly provide a safe haven for the chosen ones from the law. Defenders of the cause and members of the fourth estate maintain that the problem is not only one country nor one politician. They refer to the financiers, the ones who link with the intelligence world, the people who run big companies, the diplomats, the professors, and the political leaders from everywhere who have been loosely connected to Epstein’s circle, as the network which they point to.

The main issue is still the same:

They should publish everything they have on him.

They should expose every person.

They should protect every child.

No more secret files.

No more cover-ups.

## The Moral Argument: Children Cannot Be Bargained With

Advocates emphasize that child abuse and trafficking can by no means be used as political ammunition or for gaining a higher number of votes in one's camp. The exploitation of minors is the gravest of crimes against humanity, and giving safety to the abusers, no matter what side they belong to, is considered to be a big moral failure in the deepest sense of morals. The public's message gets more and more unequivocal:

These are not issues of political parties.

These are not issues of elections.

These are issues of children and the powerful ones who might have hurt them.


With the continuous surfacing of new accusations and incomplete pieces of information that lead to speculation, the call for the unabridged and unredacted disclosure of all the documents related to Epstein becomes more and more vehement. There might be some truth, some exaggeration, and some misrepresentation in the claims concerning Trump and other elites but there is one thing that cannot be denied:

The world is tired of secrets.

The world is tired of elite protection.

The world wants the truth-fully and immediately.

Only full openness can win back people's trust, keep safe those who may suffer later, and make sure that no one, regardless of their position, will be above the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌law.
