Drones‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ to destroy other drones have become a significant element of the war in Ukraine. Following an initial run of 20 drones, the United Kingdom and Ukraine have decided to increase the production of the OCTOPUS interceptor drone, a device invented in Ukraine with the help of British engineers and scientists. The program, according to the officials, intends to create vast quantities of the product monthly with the first production having already been given the green light. 

 In order to search for attack drones that are to be performed only once and to prevent them from doing so, for other UAVs and low-flying threat sources, the OCTOPUS interceptor drone is framed as a cheap, easily deployable, and minimalised air defence system to be used in conjunction with the existing ones. The project unites the Ukraine’s combat experience with UK’s manufacturing power thus enabling the delivery to the front line to be much faster.

 London characterizes its participation as helping to safeguard European security as well as Britain’s national interest: ministers maintain that by bolstering Ukraine’s defences, the risk of the conflict spreading and the destabilising of other European states reduces. This is the logic which is behind the recent UK technology-sharing and co-production initiatives that have been set up with Kyiv.

The analysts believe that the large-scale manufacture of cheap interception drones might compel the enemy to alter his tactics if he depends on low-cost attack UAVs, makes it difficult to calculate attrition, and changes the way both sides decide to use their air-defence resources. While UK factories are busy increasing their output, the OCTOPUS programme will probably be the main factor of the aerial defence of Ukraine and a big challenge for ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌Russia.
