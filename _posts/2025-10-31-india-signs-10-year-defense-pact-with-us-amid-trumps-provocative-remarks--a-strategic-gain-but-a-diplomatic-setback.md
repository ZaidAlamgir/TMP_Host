India‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ has made a surprising decision in its diplomacy by signing a 10-year U.S.–India Defense Framework Agreement with Washington despite the fact that tensions have been rising over the recent comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump. In a span of a few days, Trump has made statements which ire India, one being his assertion that "seven most beautiful and new jets were shot down in the recent Indo-Pak conflict of May 2025," a figure that is exactly the same as that of Pakistan's. As a result of his words, there has been a widespread worry and criticism that have reached not only the political but also the strategic fields of India and, as a consequence, there are now doubts about where Washington is heading as well as how trustworthy its partnership with New Delhi is.

The Indian government, however, despite the discomfort that surrounds it, decided to go ahead and sign a long-term defense agreement with the US, which was a clear indication of its willingness to keep up strategic cooperation with the USA. The framework outlines the areas of collaboration between the armed forces, the exchange of armaments, joint operations, sharing of intelligence, and the provision of advanced technology.

After the conclusion of the deal, U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth described the agreement as essential in constructing a "stable Indo-Pacific." In his words,

> "This accord moves forward our defense collaboration, which is fundamental to regional stability and deterrence. We are broadening our cooperation, information sharing, and technology joint efforts. Our security ties have never been deeper."

Hegseth's declaration was a clear indication of the intentions from Washington's side, that the deepening of defense relations with India is in line with the broader U.S. strategy in Asia, and thus, helps to counter a rising China and a friendly-Pakistan backed Beijing.

It is noteworthy that the language of the most recent comments from the Trump administration differs significantly from that used in Hegseth's statement. Analysts in New Delhi suggest that despite praises hurled at India by Washington in public, the latter's antagonistic political rhetoric often leads to the opposite of what is intended, i.e., less mutual respect and understanding of each other.

On the same occasion, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, talking in a more cautious and balanced manner, said,

> "India cherishes its strategic partnership with the United States; however, our engagement is grounded on mutual respect, trust, and a shared vision for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. This pact enables our defense power while making sure that India keeps its independence and that its national interests are the first ones to be considered.”

Rajnath Singh’s statements were an indication of New Delhi’s effort to convince Indian public and strategic community that the partnership is not a compromise of India’s sovereignty or independent foreign policy.

Nevertheless, the defense officials in India are still split on the issue. Several of them see the agreement as a strategic win but not one that enhances India’s reputation. They maintain that concluding such an important agreement when the tone of the American leadership toward India has been quite negative is tantamount to India losing its diplomatic standing.

Opponents of the pact also point out that, from the U.S. perspective, India is mainly a profitable defense market, an area where American technology and weapons can be sold rather than a front-line strategic ally. They suggest that the defense agreement is more about U.S. geopolitical ambitions and commercial interests than being a genuine partnership.

Although the 10-year agreement will most likely open the door for India to have access to the most advanced defense technology, increase cooperation in intelligence, and enhance joint operational capabilities, the bigger political picture is still shaky. The Trump administration's recent comments have created an atmosphere of distrust among Indian policymakers who think that Washington's approach under his administration has become more transactional.

Theoretically, the pact bolsters India's defense capabilities while concurrently revealing the geopolitical truth that Washington still sees India more as a buyer than a partner, although India is a rising power. Hence, the accord is a move in the game of strategy albeit with a significant diplomatic cost: an account of how in global partnerships respect should go together with strategy and not be overshadowed by ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌it.
