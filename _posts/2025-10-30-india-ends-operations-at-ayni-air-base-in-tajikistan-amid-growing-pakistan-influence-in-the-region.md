India's‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ decision to pull out from the Ayni Air Base in Tajikistan has given rise to a large number of politically interrelated conversations between South and Central Asia. The most prominent foreign air facility of India, once considered a landmark of India's strategic power projection beyond its borders, was located at Ayni, thereby giving it a base near the volatile region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Now, after the terminal of this foreign deployment that lasted for over twenty years, experts are viewing this event as a considerable strategic advance of Pakistan as well as the loss of New Delhi's continental ambitions.

The airbase at Ayni, not far from Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, was revamped by India's Border Roads Organisation (BRO) during the first decade of the new millennium for an estimated amount of $70 million. The base was eventually turned into a modern one capable of accommodating fighter and transport aircraft. Thus, it played an important role in India's strategic deterrence system.

Ayni's geography made it highly useful. The base was located close to the Wakhan Corridor, the narrow strip that separates Tajikistan from Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and was only 20 kilometers away from India's area of the greatest concern. From there, India could technically carry out photo reconnaissance or even strike operations to target anti-India groups in Pakistan or Afghanistan. It was a very rare instance of the Indian army being allowed to operate practically at the doorstep of Central Asia, that too with a region deep inside the area of the Greater Middle East.

India's exit was after the end of its bilateral operating agreement with Tajikistan around 2022. Although several talks were held, changes in the geopolitical landscape made it more and more difficult to agree on the renewal of the contract. Ayni lost its significance for an India that was shaping its Afghan strategy after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021. The retention of a base in the middle of a power struggle between the Russian and the Chinese in the region put Dushanbe in their grip and hence less in the game for India to act on its own initiative.

Meanwhile, with the threat to the east from a belligerent China, India has recentered its defense attention to the Indo-Pacific. So, it was not in consonance with New Delhi's changing agenda to keep a politically sensitive remote base in Central Asia.

Nevertheless, if viewed from a Pakistani angle, India’s disengagement from the Region is a soft but quite significant Taft diplomatic triumph. Without India's presence in Tajikistan, the latter could not be considered as a sort of closest and most natural borderland base for the West of Pakistan. In these years, Pakistan has been trying to build a stronger relationship with Tajikistan, and it is increasingly becoming aware of the latter's growing role in regional security.

The chief of Pakistan's ISI coming to Dushanbe this year has been interpreted by the security analysts as the two countries collaborating more closely in the security field. According to the news, the two sides talked about the issues of counterterrorism coordination as well as regional intelligence-sharing that were mainly due to the situation in Afghanistan.

This is a strategically important move because Tajikistan is not in good terms with the Taliban; one of the reasons being that Dushanbe is supportive of the ethnic Tajik minority in Afghanistan. Pakistan on the other hand, although it has relations with the Taliban, seems to be opening new ways with Tajikistan to extend its strategic footprint in Central Asia. Some experts even suggest that this could just be one piece in the bigger puzzle to counter India’s presence and influence in the region.

There are two different interpretations of Pakistan’s recent conduct. One believes that Pakistan’s involvement with Tajikistan is mainly for dealing with security issues in the northern border area of Afghanistan. The other, more convincing, perspective considers it as a part of the broader geopolitical competition with India, in which Pakistan is using its ties with both China and Russia to gain advantage in Central Asia.

Besides, the increase of Russia and China’s influence in Tajikistan is partially why India has become isolated. Russia has its largest military base in the region, while China is continuously increasing its economic and security involvement under the Belt and Road Initiative. In this situation, India was progressively pushed to the periphery and eventually had to give up its presence there.

The termination of India’s presence at Ayni is therefore far from being just a matter of rescheduling — it denotes a considerable cut of strategic depth and power. Once the place that showcased India’s ambitions for the region, Ayni now serves as an emblem of the transformation of power balances in Central Asia.

Pakistan gains a double-edged victory in the situation: a strategical and a psychological one as it removes an Indian outpost near its borders and rhetorically, it marks the ascendance of Islamabad in the diplomatic arena of a once India-dominated region. On the other hand, for New Delhi, it is the clear sign that the continental strategy has to be functionally redesigned and influence to be regained through new ways since Central Asia is progressing towards the China-Russia-Pakistan axis.

Simply put, the move of India from Ayni Air Base is a powerful message about the alteration of the local regional order - a world where power is more and more held by antagonistic blocs, and where the continued influence necessitates the virtues of strategic flexibility and prolonged, non-symbolic presence ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌beyond.
