Over the last fifteen years, Iran has developed into one of the top missile powers in the Middle East with clear achievements in range, precision, and propulsion technology. The defense industry of Tehran, which was limited to outdated imported designs, is now able to produce advanced ballistic and cruise missiles solely by domestic innovation—a change that goes way beyond the mere increase of strategic capabilities and changes the whole deterrence doctrine.

The first step of Iran’s modern missile journey was the Fateh-110 series, a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) using a solid fuel with a range of 300 km and a 500 kg payload. It is small, can be carried on a truck and therefore can be launched in a very short time, thus, allowing safe firing and a quick counterattack capability. In 2016, Zolfaghar increased the distance to 700 kilometers and introduced modern guidance systems for better accuracy. By carrying a warhead of close to 590 kg, it could be a source of extreme danger for strategic facilities and airbases far in the neighbor’s territories.

Iran was able to reach the medium-range stage of its missile development through the Shahab-3 and Ghadr systems— the bases of its strategic arsenal. The Shahab-3, a platform based on the Nodong, has a range from 1,300 to 1,900 kilometers, and a 1,000-kilogram warhead carrying capability. It is roughly 16 meters tall and can strike the entire Middle East and even some parts of Eastern Europe. The Ghadr, an enhanced version of the Shahab-3, goes the next step further and lengthens the range to around 1,950 kilometers, with better control of the vehicle during re-entry and a shorter time from the start of the launch preparation, hence, more flexibility and accuracy in operations.

Sejjil missile was a giant technological leap forward for Iran, being the first two-stage solid-fueled system in the country. Sejjil, with a range from 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and a 700-kilogram payload, is a combination of factors such as mobility, accuracy, and short launch readiness that makes it very difficult to detect and intercept. It is this missile that marks the transition of Iran from a reliance on liquid fuels to advanced solid-propellant systems, a feat only a handful of countries have made worldwide.

The 2023 unveiling of the Khorramshahr-4 is the crowning achievement of this progression. It is able to carry out a 2,000-kilometer strike of a target while carrying as much as 1,500-kilogram of the warhead and uses a very advanced engine to cut down the pre-launch time to less than 15 minutes. In addition to its small chassis, the missile also has the capability to bypass radars due to its design and, in fact, hypersonic speed makes it immune to any intercepting countermeasures—what we see here is the Iranian proficiency in missile miniaturization and survival getting better and better.

When it comes to the use of the systems, Iran has shown through its various performances that its missiles are not just for show but are in fact operational and battle-ready. The Iranian missile formations are said to have such capabilities as to be able to overcome multilayered air-defense systems through coordinated saturation attacks, the use of decoys, and high-speed maneuvers. The integration of missile missions with on-the-fly intelligence and electronic warfare is what Iran used in the drills to prove this capability to the world.

Iran has raised drone missiles to be a threat that can match the ballistic ones. Meanwhile, as these innovations continue, the Islamic Republic also introduces new long-range cruise missiles into the market with the likes of the Soumar and Hoveyzeh being the think tanks’ favorite talking points for an outrageously prolonged strike envelope of 1,300–2,000 kilometers high precision that are also radar-evasive and made to attack both land and sea targets.

In 20 years time, Iran has created a missile program that is in many aspects on par with the world's major military powers. The military and scientific aspects are intertwined in every single generational leap—be it from Fateh to Khorramshahr—that was carried out despite the harsh external restrictions.

Iran’s missile power today is the core of its strategic stance. This is a result of a remodelled regional military landscape that was made possible by innovation, persistence, and self-reliance credentials to which Iran proudly now ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌contributes.
