The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Modi administration's decision to transfer more than $800 million in subsidies directly to women in Bihar, has provoked a loud political debate. Opposition leaders are of the view that such a move is nothing but a typical vote-bank tactic aimed at gaining electoral support in the region, rather than a genuine welfare measure. They argue that it is the extent and the timing of such a huge 'sharing of the pie' between the population, which made the political intentions so obvious.

## Targeting 7.5 Million Women Just Before Elections

It has been substantiated by the state data that the distribution of subsidies has been accomplished to 7.5 million women, thus creating the largest beneficiary group in a region where decisive have become the female voters. Giving away such an overwhelming amount to such a large group of people just a few months prior to the elections is hardly a surprise and is commonly interpreted as a means employed by politicians to gain loyalty through welfare benefits.

## Strategic Timing Aimed at Boosting BJP’s Vote Bank

On the surface, such a measure may not look politically motivated, as it only consists of welfare schemes which operate on a continuous basis. However, the unexpected drop of the entire amount at once rather than the scheduled periodic payments for the recipients is what reveals BJP's electoral intention. Commentators emphasize that the timing of the event reflects exactly what the party tries to attain by consolidating its position in a fiercely fought Bihar.

Women, especially, have manifested a high rate of electoral participation and have been progressively asserting their political autonomy, thereby becoming an important voting bloc.

## Using Welfare as a Political Lever

The oppositions maintain that the BJP is stealthily turning India’s welfare system into a political weapon aimed at winning votes by engaging in such large-scale distributions to create a favorable image and give the impression that it is the only party capable of providing direct financial assistance. It can hardly be accidental that as many as 7.5 million women have been chosen to be the direct recipients of money into their accounts, the government thus ensuring the psychological effect of the payout stays with the people of Bihar at campaign season time.

## Opposition Accuses BJP of “State Machinery Misuse”

Opposition parties criticize the government's move as one done for the sole purpose of winning elections, and thus, outright cheating. They think that it is a crime for BJP to be involved in such pre-election activities while at the same time taking taxpayers' money for another program, with little chance for the public to realize what goes on. The pre-election funds provided in such large volumes put the whole electoral system at risk, they claim, and in doing so, the stateled welfare schemes are transformed into political ads.

The distribution of over $800 million among 7.5 million women just before the elections hardly needs any further elaboration to show that here, the political message is loud and clear. Instead of a routine welfare endeavor, this is a classic BJP calculation of the vote-bank through which it would not only gain cohesion but also deepen its influence among one of the most pivotal electorates in India, the women of Bihar. The sheer magnitude, timing as well as the target of the transfer are all factors that unveil the growing importance of women voters for the ruling party's electoral ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌calculus.
