The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Karnataka government has given the green light to a proposal to lease 46 mechanical sweeping machines for seven years at a total cost of ₹613 crore. This has led to questions being raised about the financial prudence of the decision, whether it is cost-efficient, and if the procurement process was transparent.

It is estimated that a single mechanical sweeping machine costs about ₹2.5 crore when one buys it outright. It means that the government can buy all the 46 machines for somewhere close to ₹115 crore which is just a small portion of the total approved rent.

## A Cost Structure That Defies Logic

Most people are wondering why the government is leasing these machines instead of buying them because the leasing details are as follows:

1. 46 mechanical sweeping machines on lease

2. Duration of rental: 7 years

3. Cost of rent: ₹613 crore

4. Cost of purchase of the same machines: ~₹115 crore

Even if the government introduces expenses for the maintenance, staffing, and fuel of the machines, experts still firmly believe that the amount of ₹613 crores is far too large for a 7-year agreement when compared to the purchase of the machines.

## Questions Over Procurement Methods

1. Opposition and community activists raise the following concerns:

2. Was there an open tender process for the contract?

3. Why the government preferred to rent rather than buy when purchase would have been significantly cheaper?

4. How did the cost rise to the level that is very difficult to justify, according to most people?

5. Is the rental contract only for the use of the machines or does it also include other services such as maintenance?

Typically, municipal corporations in India opt for a combination of purchase and rental models when acquiring mechanized sweepers. However, it is rare that a rental cost exceeds the purchase value to such an extent.

## Potential Impact on Urban Governance

One of the arguments in favor of the leasing model is that a third party is responsible for the upkeep which ensures the efficient operation of the machines, it is therefore less likely that they will be out of service for long, and also the service provider is held responsible. Nonetheless, the high price tag now threatens to overshadow the possible benefits of the operation.

Those who keep an eye on urban governance point out that such moves, especially if public money is involved, should be accompanied by transparent cost explanations to keep the public trust and be fiscally responsible.

## A Call for Clarity

As the dispute over this matter is getting more and more public attention, those in favor of transparency are urging for:

 1.Providing a breakdown of the ₹613 crore contract

 2.Revealing the operational and maintenance activities

 3.Explaining the reasons for renting instead of buying

 4. Allow an independent  audit of procurement procedures

Until these clarifications are made, Karnataka’s sweeping-machine rental plan is likely to remain under scrutiny as one of the state’s most perplexing public expenditure decisions.
