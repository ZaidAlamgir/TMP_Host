By‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ revealing and successfully flying its new domestically-built light cargo aircraft, the Simorgh, Iran has made a significant step in aerospace self-reliance. The Simorgh, a joint development of the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation (HESA) and the Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO), represents a big-picture change of Iran's technological and industrial power, a feat made possible in spite of tough sanction regimes that have been in place for over 30 years.

After a powerful and wise bird of the mythical Persian origin, the Simorgh, the plane is a manifestation of Iran's grit to defy the external forces and limitations. The Simorgh project is the direct outcome of years of local research, the engineering work-around and a well thought-out plan to get aerospace technology areas that are of strategic nature sector-independent.

As per HESA's official specifications, the Simorgh is packed with quite a few power attributes of the light cargo aircraft, e.g. the maximum takeoff weight 21.5 tons, cargo capacity 6 tons, operational range 3,900 kilometers, and the two turboprop engines 2 x 2,500 horsepower. An extensive rework has been done on the aircraft's design, which now includes a strengthened fuselage, digital flight controls, and optimized aerodynamics. The modification of the aircraft is to enable it to perform several functions, such as the transport of goods, the transfer of personnel, humanitarian aid, and medical evacuation, at the very least, on the same short-haul flights.

Since the 1980s, when the sanctions were first imposed, Iran has been barred from the U.S. and European aerospace markets. Aircraft components that go into planes manufactured by Boeing, Airbus, and other Western companies are still under embargo, thus making the country heavily dependent on reverse engineering, local innovation, and partnerships with a few nations that are either neutral or friendly. The development of the Simorgh is a statement of intent to gradually wean oneself off imports of foreign components and into a complete domestic production system, which would cover areas like aerodynamics, materials science, avionics, and propulsion engineering, to name a few.

"This accomplishment conveys the message that Iran, despite facing the most challenging situations, is fully capable of doing everything from designing, manufacturing, to flying a technologically advanced aviation unit that is fabricated entirely within its own yards," an Iranian aerospace executive, during the Simorgh's inaugural flight, remarked.

The Simorgh is a follow-up to the projects of HESA, primarily the IrAn-140 turboprop, which was the first attempt of Iran made to locally produce passenger and cargo planes. HESA has concurrently progressed in the field of military aviation, backing the creation of Kowsar and Saeqeh fighter jets (derivative of the U.S. F-5), Yasin and Dorna trainer jets, and an ever-growing fleet of Shahed-series helicopters and combat drones. Collectively, these projects are turning Iran from a purchaser in the regional market into an aerospace producer with the capability of domestic aviation both for civilian and defense sectors.

The international community considers the Simorgh as an essential element of Iran’s pragmatic long-term strategy directed at stabilizing a sovereign aerospace industry supporting military logistics, humanitarian aid, and economic progress even in the face of isolation from the global market. By accomplishing the test and going into mass production of this airplane, Iran has the local capability to design, develop, and fabricate present-day fixed-wing aircraft, a very few nations club, which also comprises the United States, Russia, China, Brazil, and several European countries.

In many ways, the coming of the Simorgh is a testament to Iran’s technology stamina and strategic brilliance. Sanctions intended to curtail Tehran’s aspirations in the aerospace domain might have inadvertently fueled the innovation and self-reliance drive. With more test flights lined up and production underway, the Simorgh is not just a name on the list of new aircraft  rather, it reflects Iran's place among the global aerospace ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌superpowers.
