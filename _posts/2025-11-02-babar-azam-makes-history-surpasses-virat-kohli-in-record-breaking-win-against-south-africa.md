In an exciting T20 International at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, Pakistan won the series 2–1 against South Africa — a success that was defined by Babar Azam’s sensational performance which made him surpass Indian star Virat Kohli in the list of the top T20 cricketers of all time.

The match which was the decider of the series saw South Africa managing to score only 139 for 9 after Pakistan’s fast bowlers, led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, ripped through their top order. While chasing the target, Pakistan ended the match in the 19th over with six wickets down and a score of 140, thanks to Babar Azam’s magnificent 68 off 46 balls.

The Pakistani batsman not only won the series for his team but also recorded his 40th half-century in T20I thus becoming the player with the most fifties in men's T20I surpassing Virat Kohli. The achievement indeed is just one in a line of several for Babar and it definitely solidifies his spot in the pool of the most prolific run-getters of the modern cricket era.

Babar’s feat goes beyond the numbers. We live in an age where six-hitters and high strike rates dominate but his remarkable consistency and neat and orthodox stroke play serve as convincing evidence that time and accuracy still play a significant role in T20 cricket. By smashing the record of Kohli - a player who is regarded as one of the greatest of his generation - is not only a reflection of his own brilliance but also the growing power of Pakistan’s batting lineup.

South Africa were limited to 139/9 as tight bowling from Afridi and Haris Rauf, who also shared early wickets, suffocated the Proteas. Despite early blows, Babar was the rock throughout the chase and also got some support from Fakhar Zaman and Iftikhar Ahmed. The partnership between Babar and Zaman not only stabilized the innings but also carried the team beyond the reach of the Proteas before Afridi wrapped up the match in style with a few quick runs.

Even though Babar Azam is no longer the captain, he is the team's most influential player. His good play and his strong mind-set always uplift the team spirit. Getting to 40 half-centuries in T20Is is indeed proof of his versatility a perfect mix of the qualities of a patient, controlled, and aggressive player who can accelerate the innings when the situation demands.

This is one of the metrics where, apart from other factors, Babar is far ahead of Kohli and hence the ongoing debate about who is the most consistent T20 batter of modern cricket will be reignited by this accomplishment. There is a long list of international matches before the next T20 World Cup and that will be Babar’s challenge to keep this good form going and to turn more of these fifties into hundreds that win games.

It was not only just a series win that Pakistan achieved over South Africa but also a power statement of their comeback. And Babar Azam’s record-breaking knock was at the very heart of that statement, once again proving that greatness is not about a single match, but about consistently being brilliant over a long time. While the Lahore crowd was applauding him, Babar did more than just breaking a record — he was elevating himself to the pantheon of the cricket’ s modern legends.
