Russia‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ has greatly increased the local production of its drones and a major factory of one of their key facilities is now flooding the market with the "Jiran" drone , a drone basically identical to the Iranian Shahed-136 model that is widely known for its use as a loitering munition. Analysts believe that Russia is making thousands of these drones per month and this industrial ramp-up is one of the fastest in the weapons production during the war.

## A Drone That Changed Modern Warfare

The world came to know the Shahed-136, an Iranian development, as the drone that was cheap, had a long range, and was very effective in asymmetric warfare, something which is a hallmark of the Middle East wars and now, the Ukraine conflict. This is what made Russia decide to put this system into its military operations , initially through importing Iranian-made units, and eventually, by large-scale local production.

The Russian copy of the drone is called "Jiran" and it still looks the same, like a slightly curved one-wing model with a warhead of the original Shahed capacity. Reportedly the Russian side swapped out a few components inside while the outer shell stayed the same.

## Inside the Production Line

The factory where the Jiran is made looks more like a car plant with rows of identical products moving through the different stages of completion. The efficiency of the personnel fixing wings to the fuselage and likewise doing the other operations at the same time is so high one can call it a kind of assembly line mass production.

Authorities assure that their lead on drone production can now be measured in output meeting the demand of thousands per month, a level that exists only in a small group of drone-farming nations, China being one of them.

An output of such magnitude clearly signals a turn in Russia's strategy: The war tool of choice for cheap drones in large numbers may be going side by side with that of conventional munitions.

Once Jiran was just a program, now it is a very loud global signal about:

the worldwide impact of Iran-based military tech.

During the last 10 years, Iran has been developing quietly and consistently until it has become one of the most innovative and prolific UAV powers in the globe. Even with sanctions in place and restricted access to high tech from the West, Iran has flourished in building a drone ecosystem that is:

1. Low in cost

2. Battle-tested

3. Very easy to copy

4. Causing major strategic disruptions

And the Shahed-136 to a large extent is the one that led to the dramatic paradigm shift in military strategy worldwide. So much that even big powers like Russia and the USA have done studies, reverse engineering or adaptations of drone design when referring to Iran.

## From Regional Power to Global Trendsetter

Once upon a time, Iran was dependent on foreign suppliers for military tech, but now it is a source of inspiration and competition for the big guys.

The fact that:

Russia base its drone development directly on an Iranian model, and

The United States publicly looking at the pieces of Iranian drones to find out countermeasures,

are the illustrations of how far the Iranian military innovation has come.

This move breaks with the tradition. Generally, military technologies are transferred from big to small players. With drones, it's the other way round:

It is Iran who is setting the example that even the superpowers follow.

## A New Era in Drone Warfare

The Jiran drone’s mass production in Russia not only deepens Moscow’s war chest but also serves as a manifestation of a tectonic shift in military dynamics worldwide.

First, Iran playing the role of a leading innovative drone manufacturer and its designs being adopted by powerful nations, is a clear signal of the coming of a new era where fast, cheap, and devastatingly effective unmanned systems change the face of war.

One thing to remember is that, in this new environment, traditional parameters of power are being altered and that is why a country like Iran can be seen as the most influential force in shaping the coming military ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌strategies.
