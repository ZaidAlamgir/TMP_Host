The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Sri Lankan cricket team has reacted with horror to the suicide bombing incident in Islamabad that escalated security concerns. In such an atmosphere, the very first ODI in Rawalpindi was planned to be held just a few hours after the attack, which claimed the lives of at least a dozen people and caused many more to be wounded. The touring team expressed their immediate concern and shock at what had happened.

It is reported that a number of players from Sri Lanka and a few support staff members not only felt the need to convey their opinion to the board but, in fact, they petitioned the board for permission to evacuate the country of Pakistan due to the security situation and the psychological impact of being in the vicinity of a terror incident. The memory of the 2009 Lahore attack on the Sri Lankan team ,one of cricket’s darkest days , haunts the players whenever the security situation in the region deteriorates.

On the other hand, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) administration not only refused to entertain the proposal but also gave an instruction to the players to execute the plan of the tour as intended. Besides, the management of the board cautioned players that any absence without their green light will be followed by a "formal review". At the same time, stressing that a replacement will be flown in if a player decides to quit the series, the board leaders warned the squad not to take any unauthorized step. In addition, the board is assuring that PCB and government security measures are in place and that the banking on them is foolproof.

Pictured after the blast, the PBC and the Board have pushed the match forward one day, and Rawalpindi will still be the venue. The interior minister of Pakistan, who is also the PCB chairman, visited the Sri Lankan officials and filled them in on the details of the measures in place to ensure their security during the visit.

There has been a moment of great tension between the concerns of the players and those of the managers, caused by these events. As much as SLC would like to see everything through and keep their promises to the rest of the cricket world, the anxieties of the players reveal that it is not easy for them to feel safe when violence occurs in the vicinity of where the matches take place in Pakistan.

The reckoning of this conflict will have an impact not only on Sri Lanka but also on broader discussions surrounding the decision-making power of the players, risk assessment, and the future of international cricket in areas that are prone to security threats. If the tour goes on without a hitch, it might be instrumental in bringing the lost trust in Pakistan as a host nation back to the surface. However, if the players decide to pull out or there are more incidents, it may become difficult once again to hold major cricket events in the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌country.
