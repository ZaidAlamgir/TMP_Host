Melissa is tormenting everyone with hurricanes. It is one of the strongest hurricanes in the Caribbean. Winds reached speeds at nearly killing intensity speeds of 175 miles and more thus classifying this storm under Category 5 making it one of the worst in perhaps most modern Jamaican disaster history.

Meteorologists say that it's pretty much the "first of its kind" storm, with the extreme wind speeds and very slow movement. Crawls at a speed of about 3 mph, hanging about above the island for hours and dropping rains until the earth saturates.

It is said by hurricane experts that major parts of infrastructure would have happened in floodplains and landslides due to severe destructive effects; these would also increase by the slow moving Melissa. Another factor that would be directly experienced is coastal storm surges along the southern coasts of Jamaica; one surge can rise up to four meters above sea level and threaten entire communities with flooding.

Public authorities have declared a national state of emergency. Thousands of persons have been removed from at-risk areas along the coast and portions of emergency shelters have begun to fill. In the meantime, citizens of Jamaica have been urged indoors by the Prime Minister, who also referred to the storm as the "defining test for national resilience."

There are many accumulation variables, all of which have played an important factor in creating the deadly nature of this hurricane. The swath of destruction caused by winds sustained at 175 mph could level houses, shred steel-reinforced concrete roofs, uproot trees across the island, and create low-lying coastal areas that already show severe flooding. Some of the bays are submerged by more than 12 feet of water; up to 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rain is forecast to fall across the regions, which will worsen the state of emergency as a result of bursting rivers and drainage systems. Power cuts, lines of communication, and blockade of the water supply spread across Jamaica. The impacts on tourism, agriculture, and transport will suspend Jamaica's main revenue earner for a long time, with initial damage estimates going into the billions. 

Meteorologists have forecast the worst impacts for this great fury and slow-moving character of hurricane Melissa. Such is the theory.

Gilbert, previously assumed to be the worst disaster ever for Jamaica - sustained winds of 121 mph aloft  near 147 mph at gusts damage and destruction to over 100,000 homes, on top of what was lost to agriculture. It virtually made a fifth of the population homeless by flooding coastal towns with a storm surge of 19 feet.

This has indeed been brought up because winds as high as almost 125 mph were attributed to Hurricane Charlie when it passed over the island during August dates of the year 1951. Almost total devastation did occur in the southeastern part of the island, with Kingston above the record severe rainfall of more than 17 inches, causing landslides and fatalities, along with banana stocks suffering destruction of close to 70 percent. The storm would go on to claim 152 lives and wreak havoc within towns such as Morant Bay and Port Royal.

Other hurricanes accused of such damage include that of the 1903 Jamaica Hurricane and then the Hurricane of 1944, both of which wreaked havoc with winds above averaging at 120 mph. A bit closer to now, Hurricane Beryl (2024) with winds exceeding 165 mph just brushed aside the island, making it quite terrifying because of the increase trend of the intensity of hurricanes. 

The high frequency of Category 5 hurricanes and indeed even their high intensity would have been brought about by such hurricane-Melissa. The ocean temperature rise may correlate with the increasing intensity of hurricanes. Like Jamaica, all island states have much of their vulnerability, politically, even geographically they are all coastal countries, with over 60 percent of their population much economically dependent on tourism and agriculture. 

Indeed, the scientific communities warned that with the acceleration of climate change, hurricanes will probably have rather more cases like Melissa: stronger, slower, and worse. 

Deep within the historic registers of Jamaica, hurricane Melissa would find itself a premium placement as among the most powerful ruptures known and greatest havoc of storm damage ever recorded. In the winds that rise and pour down life taking surges, those messages would be what economistic and humanitarian concern would engage with the nation in necessary resilience for a long-term lasting result. 

These matters now at the very top hold place most saving lives and providing critical needs after immediate disaster. However, currently, under this storm, an entirely more persistent cartel of strengthening climate reality continues for the Caribbean countries: storm after storm, ever stronger into the coming years.
