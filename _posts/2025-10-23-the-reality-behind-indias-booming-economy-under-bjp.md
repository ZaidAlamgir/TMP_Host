The BJP-run India is labeled the world's fourth-largest economy by the very administration that makes it seem a rapidly growing and influential country in the global arena. The reality, however, is a complete contrast to what is being portrayed. Even after that, India's GDP is quite a distance away from China's when you take into account that both countries have almost the same number of people. India's economic output is $4.19 trillion, but when you factor in the population sizes of both countries, China's economy of $19.4 trillion is still way ahead.

Besides, India's population is a major factor in determining the country's economic production. India is home to 1.4 billion people, which means that its population is 7–8 times that of Japan and 17–18 times that of Germany, but its total GDP is far less than that of these countries in terms of per capita. The implication here is that the enormous population has not led to a proportionate economic power or people's standard of living.

Per capita income shows the gap just as clearly. The average Indian earns roughly $2,990, whereas the figure for China is $12,614, for Germany $55,800, for Japan $33,767, and for the USA $79,000. The gap very visibly reveals that the majority of Indians are not the ones who are experiencing the economic progress that the politicians boast of.

India’s food situation hasn’t gotten a lot better, and it remains one of the major issues in the country. The Global Hunger Index reports that India’s score for 2025 is 25.8, which puts it in the "serious" category and ranks it 102nd out of 123 countries, indicating the problem of long-term malnutrition.

During BJP’s last ten years in power, Unemployment has remained at high levels. The total rate was at 4.2% in 2024, and youth unemployment was much more elevated. Initiatives aimed at job creation have barely if at all made a difference.

India's government plan to make the country a leader in Infrastructure Development is more like a far-off dream than something that is really happening. Even though the yearly infrastructure outlay is as much as ₹12 lakh crore, the progress has been slow and has suffered from issues of delay, land acquisition, and lack of money, mainly in the villages. The urban areas have been able to upgrade their infrastructures, while most parts of the country are still without good roads, electrification, and logistics networks.

Under BJP, India has not achieved uniform economic growth. In fact, the growth has been largely overstated. Party slogans or GDP rankings should never be the measure of economic progress but rather the real changes in standards of living, employment, and equitable distribution of ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌wealth.
