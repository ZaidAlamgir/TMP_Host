Violent‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Protests Erupt in Cameroon Following Contested Re-Election of Paul Biya

Cameroon has been rocked by violent protests after the 92-year-old President Paul Biya was able to secure an unbelievable eighth term in office. According to official results, Biya won with 53.66% of the vote, a result that has been questioned almost everywhere, i.e., both within the country and outside.

The violence has gone a notch higher as the impasse between the authorities and the people led to the killing of at least four citizens, whose bodies have been found while the streets were left covered in blood, shouting for their rights. The protesters believe that Biya not only rigged the elections but also that he is the one who broke the democratic normative by his continuity in power for so long.

In the meantime, claims of deceit in the voting process coming from the other side of the fence have also heated the debate. A French think tank called Africa Review revealed that the opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma was the actual winner of the presidential elections with 70% of the votes. These allegations, though not confirmed by the authorities in Cameroon, have led to a heightened perception of ballot fraud and have deepened the political divide.

Present crisis could be a wake-up call to the people of Cameroon about the state of their democracy, a very shaky one, as Mr. Biya has been the boss since 1982. Retorting to their critics, Biya's side argues that the opponents talking about the leader's ninth decade are basically the same ones who question the functioning of the government and the electoral commission and claim to be the only true voices in democracy, while actually they silence the opposition.

While demonstrations are going on, apprehensions concerning the escalation of violence and the advent of the political instability situation are voiced. The worldwide community has made its stand by calling for the restoration of peace and order as well as the engagement of leaders from both sides in talks for calming the situation down and forestalling any further aggravation.

Next weeks' days may turn out to be the turning moment for Cameroon's polity when not only citizens' but also observers' eyes will be fixed on the government whether it will react to the purported electoral fraud by committing a blitz or repression against the resistance will be the order of the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌day.
