The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ World Test Champions, South Africa, ensured their hard work paid off by defeating India by 30 runs at the legendary Eden Gardens in Kolkata and taking a 1–0 lead in the two-match Test series. In a game that saw the pendulum of control swinging, bowler's discipline, and players' nerves being tested to the extreme, the visitors were able to keep calm and collected when the time came.

Needing a demanding fourth-innings total, India, however, struggled to convert their starts into big scores and were dismissed at crucial moments. The turning point of the match was Keshav Maharaj's decisive over in which he dismissed Axar Patel and Mohammed Siraj twice in a row. His one over one ball double wreaked havoc at the Indian lower order and gave South Africa absolute control of the situation. To make things even worse, Indian captain Shubman Gill couldn't bat due to injury, so basically, the hosts were a batter short in the nervy dying moments of the game.

To achieve what is expected from a world champion side, South Africa's bowlers displayed the composure and accuracy. They got Maharaj to turn the ball sharply and to get more than one unpredictable bounce from a very worn-out pitch in Kolkata and while South Africa's fast bowlers kept attacking from the other end, they were trying to wear out the batsmen. It was their ability to be so thoroughly disciplined over very long bowling spells that in the end made all the difference.

India’s middle order came to the crease determined to battle it out, but the lack of good partnerships and the absence of their captain forced them into an impossible situation. After Maharaj got the breakthrough, the pursuit very quickly fell apart, thus ensuring a victory for the Proteas.

With this result, South Africa have a great opportunity to win the series early while India are forced to take the risk of losing their home series if they don’t manage to win the second Test ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌match.
