German‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ luxury carmaker Porsche AG has, in its first nine months' report, shown a steep 99% drop of its profits. The report points to the company’s costly transition to electric vehicles and a plunge in demand in important markets such as China as the reasons for the loss.

The report on Porsche’s financial performance shows that the car maker’s net profit went down from €4.03 billion to only €40 million, thus, recording the most significant decline in its history. Besides, during the third quarter of 2025, the company registered a €966 million operating loss which is far from what the analysts had predicted.

The hard hit was a result of pump priming for electric vehicle production, postponing of product launches, and dwindling sales in China - a long-standing market where Porsche has been raking in high revenues. The management team referred to the time as "a strategic transformation" period and admitted that they could not avoid financial difficulties in the short term as the brand was getting ready for the all-electric future.

Porsche has, for instance, paid €2.7 billion to renew its factories and written off close to €1 billion in restructuring and the cost of developing new products. The carmaker is changing its production processes to be compatible with the next-generation EVs, for example, electric versions of the Macan and 718 series.

Firstly, analysts explain that although Porsche’s daring shift reflects the industry trend towards electrification, the rate and the cost of the change have put pressure on its margins. Adding to the problem are poor global sales of luxury cars and among others, the increased competition from both Western and Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.

However, Porsche’s management team is ruling out such a disastrous scenario and is instead optimistic and confident about the company’s long-term strategy and vision. The executives underline that the current difficulties are the price to be paid on the road to necessary change - which will enable Porsche to be competitive in a fast electrifying automotive environment.

When the brand is speeding up its transition to eco-friendly mobility, whether it will be successful or not will hinge on the speed with which it will be able to combine innovation with profitability. In case consumers welcome Porsche’s forthcoming electric vehicles and production challenges get resolved, the carmaker will be able to turn this dark period into a shining one and thus, confirm once again its heritage as one of the world’s most legendary performance ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌automakers.
