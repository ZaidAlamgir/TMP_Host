New‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Delhi, An explosion that shook the national capital and made the country grieve, happened near the Red Fort late in the evening of November 10, 2025. The blast happened near Red Fort metro station where a white Hyundai i20 went up in flames at a traffic signal all of a sudden. The place, which is normally jam-packed with evening commuters and tourists, became a terror-stricken area in a matter of seconds.


The official statements say that the death toll has mounted to thirteen while the injured have also numbered more than twenty. After the detonation, some of the vehicles were lit on fire. In addition to the flames from these vehicles, the fire quickly spread to some other cars that were parked in the vicinity. The fire brigade and the police were there with the necessary tools to bring the fire under control and after an hour of hard work, they succeeded in it.

Officials are treating the episode as a major priority and are on full alert. Delhi police have registered a complaint with the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Explosives Act citing first information report. Apart from Delhi Police, National Investigating Agency and National Security guard are also on board for forensic and evidence tasks.

The disaster that happened at the nearest point to the Red Fort, one of the most meaningful and oldest Indian independence symbol landmarks, is what made the tragedy so painful. People were stopped from entering the place with barricades put up around it and also the security was strengthened not only in Delhi but also in other ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌states.

Following‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his heartfelt sorrow and sympathy to the victims' families through his post on X. In his posts, he wrote:-

> "Deepest sympathies to the people who lost their dear ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening. God bless the injured with a speedy recovery. The authorities are there to help those in distress." On the occasion, he also indicated cooperation with Amit Shah and other officials by saying, "I have spoken to Amit Shah and other officials and coordinated with them after the review."

After reviewing the scene with the local police and administration, the Home Minister, Amit Shah, reiterated the determination of the government to hunt down the culprits responsible for the incident. He said that every bit of care and support was being extended to the injured and their families."

The people of the country have cheered the victims and their families on through their prayers and tweets. On the other hand, leaders from various political parties have condemned the incident and appealed for increased security arrangements to be made.

This explosion at the Red Fort area in Delhi is a disturbing development concerning India's security context. The tragic occurrence of death and injuries poses critical questions about city safety, the character of the terror threat in India, and the authorities' preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to such attacks. Firstly, the police investigation will uncover the full story whether this is a targeted terror act, a sudden suicide attack or something else but, the event already highlights the necessity of strong anti-terror strategies, quick and efficient exchange of secret information between agencies, and security for the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌public.
