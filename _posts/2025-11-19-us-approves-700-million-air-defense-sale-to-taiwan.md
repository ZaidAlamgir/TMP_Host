The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ United States has greenlit a nearly $700 million military sale to Taiwan, which includes very advanced components for the NASAMS air-defence missile system, making the second U.S. arms package for Taipei in a single week and the total value now stands at around $1 billion.

In the words of American officials, the kit offers the most next generation air-defense installations along with the needed equipment, training, technical support, and spare parts. NASAMS, a standard shared by the US, NATO allies, and now Ukraine, is a surface-to-air missile system which can intercept a target in a very short range and use guided missiles to kill it, such as coming drones, cruise missiles, or aircraft.

The Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan expressed its gratitude towards the decision, mentioning that the transaction would greatly improve their power against increasingly aerial threats from China. Analysts point out that Taiwan has been equipping itself with mobile air-defense systems that can be quickly deployed and are less vulnerable in line with Beijing’s escalation of the military pressure via frequent sorties, missile launches, and large-scale exercises around the island.

The signal clearance comes right after another US package of military aid worth about $300 million that was approved earlier in the week and which included logistical and intelligence support. The two deals taken together convey the message of the US to Taiwan that it still stands with them under the Taiwan Relations Act despite the fact that there are high tensions owing to China's displeasure over the cooperation in defense sector with the island.

China's Foreign Ministry lamented the last ok and held the US responsible for regional instability and "sending the wrong message" to pro-independence forces. Nevertheless, Washington insists on the defense character of its arms sales and their importance for the maintenance of peace in the Taiwan Strait area.

With the new deal, Taiwan is one step closer to the implementation of a more integrated air-defense system capable of meeting modern multi-directional threats, which is becoming more and more of a necessity as the regional security situation ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌tightens.
