Ex-Chancellor‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Olaf Scholz stated publicly that the fall of his administration was a consequence of fights over money for Ukraine only. Speaking to Die Zeit, Scholz exposed that the coalition disbanded because of the failure to agree upon the €15 billion or so that the extra aid to Kyiv and the refugees from Ukraine living in Germany would have cost.

Scholz said that the last straw was when people trying to get the 2025 federal budget through kept running into refusal. November 2024 saw the situation turn sour when Christian Lindner, Finance Minister, and FDP party leader was fired by Scholz as he accused him of creating obstacles for Germany’s commitments to Ukraine. It later became known that Scholz planned to ask for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag in January thereby indicating serious problems in the coalition.

According to Scholz, he was urging the necessity of providing the needed support to Ukraine with weapons as well as money but not once did Lindner agree or offer him any cooperation. The former head of government made it a point that he was in favor of offering assistance to Kyiv, yet he could not see the logic in redirecting funds from very important local areas such as old-age provisions, healthcare, and social welfare into foreign areas.

“I terminated the operations of the preceding government since there was no agreement reached on approximately €15 billion to finance the additional measures for Ukraine and the Ukrainians in Germany,” Scholz explained, further indicating that the coalition neither could make an equilibrium between fulfilling its international obligations nor securing the country's internal stability.

Scholz was the Chancellor of Germany from December 2021 to May 2025. His regime was brought to an end due to a mixture of factors dominated by a series of financial disputes never seen before, political polarization within the coalition, and mounting criticism of Germany’s role in the Ukraine war by the public. The government's downfall thus marked a turning point in German politics, raising questions about Berlin's long-term strategic role in European security and her ability to manage domestic issues while meeting international ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌commitments.
