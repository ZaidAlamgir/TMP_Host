Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, fresh from being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has ignited a storm of controversy after calling for an “increase in pressure and escalation”  a euphemism many interpret as military intervention to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Machado declared that only through a US-led show of force could Maduro “understand that it’s time to go,” framing military escalation as a path toward what she described as a “peaceful and orderly transition.”

The comments have raised sharp criticism, with many observers noting the irony of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate advocating for bombs as tools of peace. Yet, Machado has defended her stance, claiming her Nobel recognition gives her “higher protection” and global legitimacy in calling for regime change.

Behind the scenes, reports suggest that Machado’s team has been in quiet coordination with the Trump campaign, offering strategic arguments for a tougher US posture toward Caracas. This comes amid Washington’s recent deployment of thousands of troops, warships, and aircraft to the Caribbean, officially under an “anti-drug” operation but widely seen as a cover for coercive pressure on Venezuela.

Machado, long known for her unwavering opposition to the Maduro government, insists that her movement is preparing for the “correct moment” to act, hinting at a possible synchronization with US operations in the region.

While the Venezuelan government has denounced these statements as proof of foreign interference and imperial ambition, international observers are left questioning the paradox of a “peace laureate” calling for bombs a development that blurs the line between diplomacy and warfare in the name of democracy.
