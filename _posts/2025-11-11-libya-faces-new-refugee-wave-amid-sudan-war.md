The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ war in Sudan has caused a huge humanitarian crisis in Libya. As a result of the data, the country is the home of about 100,000 refugees and migrants, the majority of them coming from the areas full of wars and the neighboring countries with authoritarian regimes.

Of the refugee population, 84,400 people are Sudanese, as a result of a violent uprising in 2023 they had to leave their country. Other major groups of refugees include 8,900 Eritreans who are running away from endless military service and political repression; 5,300 Syrians who have been displaced due to the Syrian civil war; 2,300 Ethiopians and 1,900 South Sudanese that are in search of peace in countries with stable governments and beyond their countries of origin.

Libya as a major transit point to Europe has become a place where migrants and refugees' movement is hindered since they are ill-fated to cross the Mediterranean. But according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), this path has become the riskiest migration route in North Africa with a high rate of fatalities.

The tragic war in Sudan has caused a large-scale displacement of people, whereby some of these people are seeking refuge in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. In Eritrea, the repression of the people and constant forced conscription still push numerous people to flee. To sum it all up, traffickers along the smuggling networks and the Sahara are taking advantage of the desperation of the migrants to trap them in transit hubs all over Libya.

Due to the unstable political situation in Libya, as well as the fact that the country is still dominated by militias, the place has been a dangerous refuge for those who have escaped from their countries. The predicament in which the majority of the abducted people find themselves is that they become victims of the common mistreatments of the abusers: they are, generally, abuse, extortion and detention - with very little international oversight.

The matter has become a lethal one. At least 18 of the deaths of the migrants took place as a result of the events that transpired off the coast of Sorman; 90 people were saved from there in October 2025, and this is just one of the many instances of dangers that are faced during water journeys to be highlighted. Human rights groups report that refugee detention centers across the country are filled to capacity, run by militias, and frequently involve harsh treatment of detainees.

The camps are alive and kicking in spite of the global denunciations, and the refugees in these places are the ones who suffer the most, as they are harassed, forced into labor, and beaten. Relief organizations are sounding the alarm that, if the situation goes unattended, it will only get worse.

The EU-Libya accord that was signed in October 2025, has as its main objective the tightening of border security as well as the facilitation of the return of migrants. Nevertheless, the policy has raised a lot of controversies. NGOs have accused European and Libyan authorities of pushing back people illegally, shootings, and committing human rights violations in sea and desert areas.

Critics, including humanitarian organizations, have raised concerns about the European Union's involvement in anti-smuggling operations made in Libya. They claim that the measures taken in that regard prioritize border security at the expense of the protection of refugees.

On the other hand, the war in Sudan has resulted in the suffering of hundreds of migrants from Sudan, Chad, and Niger, who have been stranded in the Sahara desert with no way to either return home or continue their journeys.

The refugee crisis that Libya is currently facing is not a localized disaster but a component of the overall chaos of the region which is caused by the factors such as wars, oppression, and the lack of attention from the international community. As the war in Sudan continues and European migration policies become more and more stringent, thousands of people are left in the middle of nowhere and living under appalling conditions. They are not only the victims of political instability but also of the global indifference.

Without serious measures being implemented to safeguard the rights of refugees and to combat the reasons that force them to move, Libya will still be a place where one can witness the tragic consequences of conflicts and migration policy failures in North ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌Africa.
