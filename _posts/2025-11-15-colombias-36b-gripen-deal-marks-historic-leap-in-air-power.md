Colombia​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ has inked a historic pact worth $3.6 billion with Sweden's Saab for the procurement of 17 Gripen E/F multirole fighter jets. Thus, the South American nation is fuel power air has one of the most massive overhaul for the past several decades. The deals consist of 15 Gripen E single-seat fighters and 2 Gripen F dual-seat trainers with deliveries from 2026 to 2032. This stepwise time frame would give Colombian Air Force (FAC) ample time to slowly wean off the old Kfir fleet and at the same time, incorporate a brand-new combat aircraft into the system.

For Colombia, the Gripen E/F is a considerable progressive leap. The aircraft is outfitted with an AESA radar, various electronic warfare systems, and a feature-rich network-centric combat system. Sweden’s export is known for its lesser operational costs as compared to other Western fighters which, therefore, makes it the best strategic choice for a long-term sustainability solution. Besides, the platform provides low cycle times and top-notch maintainability—both very important for the hard mission profile in Colombia.

Besides the military benefits, the agreement has an extensive industrial cooperation portion. Saab is geared towards maintenance, systems integration, and technology transfer with Colombia aerospace companies. Local jobs created from this will not only enhance the skill of Colombia engineers, but also make Colombia a hub of regional maintenance for the Gripen in the near future.

Moreover, the purchase has raised the issue of which country powers the sky in the Latin America region. Apart from Brazil which already has Gripen fighters in its fleet, the acquisition ensures that the interoperability to join forces on training and for defense technology is not only possible but easy too. The jets will enable the Colombians to protect their frontiers, NSA antidrug programs, and engage in multinational exercises with their Western partners more effectively.

The Colombian Air Force would be considered lucky if they manage to get all the aircraft on time since they will embark on a journey of radical change, in 2026. The Gripen E/F squadron will be the Colombian air force capability’s pillar of strength probably for the next 3 decades unlocking a definitive shift to futuristic, viable, and ex-imperial great-power aligned air ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌power.
