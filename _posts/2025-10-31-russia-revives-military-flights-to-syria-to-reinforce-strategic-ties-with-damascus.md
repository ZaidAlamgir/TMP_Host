Moscow‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ has brought back military flights to the major air base in Syria, which is a clear sign of a fresh effort to bolster the strategic partnership with Damascus amid changes in regional alliances and the return of geopolitical rivalry in the Middle East.

It has been confirmed that Russian military planes were engaged in the Hmeimim operations, which is a key air base in Syria’s Latakia province from where Moscow has been carrying out its regional operations since 2015. This step is interpreted as part of Russia’s grand plan to reassert its dominance in the region and keep the upper hand over Damascus.

Although Syria has managed to secure financial support from several Arab countries and limited military cooperation with Türkiye and thus, is not completely dependent on Moscow for survival, it still needs Russia’s aid in critical areas like logistics and weapons supply. Moscow is still one of the biggest defense partners of Syria, providing it with military training, equipment, and air defense systems.

Meanwhile, Russia also sees Syria as a must-have in its strategy. Back then, Russia had a lot of influence over Damascus when the Assad regime was in power and now it is trying to make sure that Syria will not turn to the US for help. For the Kremlin, keeping good ties with Syria means that it can still have a say in the Eastern Mediterranean as well as protect its other interests in the region.

The renewed engagement means a lot for both the countries. For Damascus, working with Moscow means access to the much-needed defense capabilities and logistical support which is the time when national reconstruction and regional stability have become the major priorities. For Russia, it is a step toward solidifying her long-term military presence and blocking off the influence of the West in the Middle East by deepening its alliance with Syria.

Moscow and Damascus look to be on the same page when it comes to recharging their historical partnership which has been the foundation of their cooperation through the ages and is still of strategic value for both sides in the highly divided world, they have done so by bringing back military flights and expanding defense ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌coordination.
