In response to the growing pressure from Washington, India has confirmed its resolve to be energy-independent and is now back in the game of buying oil from Russia. Reuters quotes the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) as the buyer of five cargoes of Russian crude for December shipment from non-sanctioned suppliers, which is a clear signal of New Delhi's energy policy to go on with its domestic energy agenda irrespective of any geo-political clash.

The decision is made after the US has imposed the new sanctions on the Russia's top energy companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, as a part of a broader plan to reduce Moscow's oil exports worldwide, thereby restricting its revenue sources that are fueling the war. In addition to the above, Washington has been diffidently urging India to lessen her purchases of Russian oil, which has been in considerable volumes since 2022.

Nevertheless, Indian authorities are adamant that their oil procurement is in line with international regulations.

> "We are under no circumstances going to stop the purchase of Russian crude. The Russian crude itself is not sanctioned. Only the entities and the shipping lines," said Anuj Jain, finance director of Indian Oil.

After the outbreak of the Russiaâ€“Ukraine war, India has become one of the major importers of cheap Russian oil, and in most cases, India is refining and exporting the made products to the world market  Europe, for instance. Thanks to this move, New Delhi has been able to keep its local market immune to energy price hikes and at the same time, improve its refining margins.

Experts are of the opinion that India mirrors the global energy politics with a realistic eye and puts the question of energy affordability and security of supply first, rather than the geopolitics of the West. Having domestic energy demand expected to double in the next several years, India is seemingly resolved to keep her oil sources diversified, at least, as long as Western powers have sanctioned Moscow.

Simply put, India's latest action indicates that its energy policy will be dictated by the national interest rather than any external pressure, thus paving the way for the confrontation between New Delhi and Washington in the upcoming months.
