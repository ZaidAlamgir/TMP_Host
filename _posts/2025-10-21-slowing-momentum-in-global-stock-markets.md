Global stock markets are experiencing a clear deceleration, as rising interest rates, falling corporate profits and rising uncertainty make it difficult for investors to make confident investment decisions. 

The MSCI World Index is down about 8% in the last quarter, its largest decline in nearly three years. In the U.S., technology stocks that were at the forefront of the rally have begun to roll over because valuations have had a major expansion and demand in those stocks has softened.

European markets are facing pressure from rising energy prices and declining factory activity, which are weighing on investor sentiment in that region. Asian markets have also struggled to find forward momentum: In particular, China’s CSI 300 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng have been falling day after day, as turmoil in the property sector and capital flight add selling pressure to the stock market. This isn’t simply a short-term market correction — this is a larger loss of confidence connected to market uncertainty. Investors are increasingly looking to transfer into safe assets like cash, gold, or short-term bonds. 

After several years of optimism, global markets — and the global economy — have found a resting place so investors can reassess expectations. The slowdown helps to demonstrate that the investment environment is transitioning, and thinking strategically about their portfolio is becoming increasingly important. Caution and specific allocation will be important as global markets adjust to a tougher economic environment with an increase in financial pressures worldwide.
