It‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ is said that Buckingham Palace has decided to cut all ties remaining with Prince Andrew, to strip him of his titles that were left and to remove him from his official residence. The action represents a last and most decisive step in the Royal Family’s attempt to distance itself from the scandal that has persisted over the Duke of York’s association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who has been convicted.

Once a major figure in the royal household, Prince Andrew has been on the receiving end of public scrutiny for years after it was revealed that he had a close relationship with Epstein. The case got complicated when Virginia Giuffre accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was a minor, which he has always denied. Although a civil lawsuit was eventually settled off the court, the scandal has forever stained his image and reputation in the public's eye.

It was stated by palace insiders that the decision was in line with measures taken by King Charles III to ensure the monarchy’s integrity. “The main aim is to bring back public trust and to separate very clearly the institution from the deeds of an individual,” was the comment of a senior royal aide.

By this act, Andrew will no longer be in any official position to use the title “His Royal Highness” and will be deprived of his royal residence. Reports also say he will move to a private place that is not part of the royal estate.

However, once on the good side, as one of the Queen’s favorite sons, Andrew has fallen spectacularly and completely. His bungled interview with BBC in 2019, in which he tried to justify his relationship with Epstein, is broadly considered as the moment that led to his public downfall and made him irreversible.

Buckingham Palace hasn’t come out with a comprehensive statement but the decision is a clear indication of how the monarchy is determined to reform and hold itself accountable in the Elizabethan era that is coming to an end.

As far as Prince Andrew is concerned, this is probably the last public life chapter that is closed with him being cut off from the institution he once proudly represented and ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌isolated.
