The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ two countries, India and China, have re-established commercial flights after a span of more than five years during which there were no direct air services. This is a major point of easing the frozen relations of the two sides.

The return of IndiGo, one of India's private airlines, to China was celebrated with a crowd of approximately 180 people as the flight took off from Kolkata's Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on 26 October 2025, heading to Guangzhou, China. The route Kolkata to Guangzhou indicates the first stage of a project that is expected to have a daily non-stop flight between the two countries shortly.

It all started with the suspension of direct flights in the first quarter of 2020, which was initially due to the pandemic of Covid-19 and later the border tensions between the two countries after the Galwan Valley clash in 2020. Resumption, hence, is as significant and symbolic as it is really beneficial.

The Indian government is confident that direct air links will create more excellent opportunities for "people to people contact" and will "slowly lead to the normalisation of bilateral exchanges." Thus, from the perspective of business and tourism the reopening of the route brings the advantage of ease of logistics: besides that traveling time and cost of air-connectivity will be cut down to a great extent, especially for the regions of eastern India and southern China, they will also become more accessible.

However, the suspension reinstated flights between the two countries cannot be taken as a sign of mere strategic context improvement. These two countries are still strategic adversaries who compete for regional influence, economic advantages, and military position by all means possible, each of them. The resumed flights should not be seen as the total reconciliation of the two parties; in fact, many issues concerning the border, trade, and security are still pending.

For instance, India heavily depends on China for the import of goods, and the latter poses a huge challenge for both of them to rebuild trust because of the years that talks have been at a standstill and standoffs between military troops along the high-altitude frontier. In the meantime, however, New Delhi treats the reopening of the link as a tactical move: doing business with China while not surrendering strategic autonomy.

Actually, the inaugural trip from Kolkata to Guangzhou is filled with possibilities: the trade of textiles, jute, and manufacturing inputs; tourism flows; and the facilitation of Chinese businessmen's travel to Eastern India and vice versa. The local entrepreneurs of Kolkata embraced the resumption of the route as a means to enhancing the city's commerce and making it more facilitated.

The workers at Guangzhou’s Baiyun International Airport welcome the reestablishment of the link with India and propose that they will be more than willing to prompt the opening of different direct flights to India by airlines which are present in Baiyun, among them there might be the Guangzhou-Delhi ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌route.
