At‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ least 19 people have lost their lives in a Russian missile attack on a residential high-rise in the western Ternopil region of Ukraine, and over 37 have been wounded, say the regional authorities. The firing that heavily damaged a residential area in a city far away from the front lines, killed a lot of people, making it one of the riskiest strikes in western Ukraine within the last couple of months.

Around midnight, a missile smashed the windows of the apartment building, causing a number of the building's stories to fall. People who lived in the building became victims of the collapse and were stuck under the remains. Emergency crews rolled up their sleeves and worked the whole night long to get people trapped and put out the fire which started in the aftermath of the crash. The local authorities announced that they cannot confirm the number of dead and that it may go up as the search and rescue works are still under way.

Local people who saw it happen with their own eyes, told how their hearts were pounding with terror when the explosion broke the windows of the whole neighborhood, and a huge column of smoke was rising to the sky. "It shook everything, and right after that, we heard a lot of people shouting for help coming from the building," said one of the neighbours.

Ternopil is hundreds of kilometers away from the eastern front line and has been regarded as one of the relatively safe districts in Ukraine. Surprisingly, these past months, Russia has intensively launched missiles and drones farther into Ukrainian territory where it has been attacking the infrastructure, the logistics hubs, and more than ever now, civilian houses as well.

The strike was condemned by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who named it "another act of terror against our people" and he urged the Western partners to provide Ukraine with better air-defense systems. Russia's long-range attacks will escalate in the next couple of months, as the winter approaches, according to the officials, it is the Kremlin's way of trying to put pressure on the Ukrainian population and the energy sector.

As a result, the elites of Europe and humanitarian organizations, among others, were quick to voice their disapproval of the incident that they consider illegal under international laws. The United Nations' bodies make it clear that the repeated bombings of civilian infrastructures are the main reasons for the spiraling humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.

While the rescue teams are still at work in Ternopil looking for people trapped under the rubble, the relatives whose chests are tight with worry due to the disappearance of their loved ones are roaming around. Moreover, the local government is getting ready for the next steps in securing the building after the huge damage. For a great number of people living there, the occurrence has become a harsh lesson that the war has not left any corner of the nation ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌unscathed.
