Anti-Christian​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ violence is spreading more and more over Europe and it is a cause for great alarm. On the one hand, there is an increase in the destruction of churches and religious symbols, but we also hear more and more about the assaults of those who identify themselves as Christian. The recent data have made it very clear that this issue is not a local one, but it is spread over different countries and makes up the general hostility against Christian communities and institutions.

Among the European countries, Germany is the one that caused the greatest worry and it is responsible for 33 church arsons which is the largest number of such cases. Most of the time, it is the burning of the places of worship, the destruction of altars, and the damaging of the religious materials that are reported — the cases in which they not only lose their things but also their faith.

Overall, the anti-Christian offenses recorded in Germany amount to 337; thus, it ranks the third position on the European continent. The countries which have reported higher numbers than Germany are France with 770 and the United Kingdom with 502 incidents, which implies that the matter is not concentrated somewhere, but is a European challenge.

The problem of defiling the places of worship and the Christian symbols has been a major headache for France and a cause of concern for Christianity. The root causes of the issue are said to be ideological extremism, social problems, and the decline of the respect for the places of worship. The same trend happened in the UK where the rise of the harassment and the destruction of the sacred sites, statues, and the memorials has been reported.

The incidents to which authorities in these states refer cover:

1. The setting on fire of churches and chapels

2. The cutting off of the heads or the total destruction of the statues of the saints

3. The defiling of altars and the religious art

4. The physical beating of the clergy or the believers

These events have led to the debates on religious tolerance, the protection of the cultural heritage that is not enough and the losing of Europe's historical Christian roots.

Specialists point out that the frequency of these occurrences indicates that the social issues are more serious than people think. Officially the churches are the places where the communities do their religious practice, however, they are also cultural landmarks and historical treasures —therefore, the destruction of them is an assault on both the faith and the heritage.

The rising numbers are a clear indication of the need for stronger protection that the various governments and religious groups are seeking. Quite contrary to what they expect, they still have to face the reality that anti-Christian hate in Europe is a problem which is rapidly growing and therefore requires their intervention, together with the calling to account of those responsible and their joint ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌response.
