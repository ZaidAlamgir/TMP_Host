Between the 8th and 14th centuries, Muslim physicians created one of the most advanced systems of medicine of any time in human history. They combined faith, observation, and reason to create medicine as a scientific discipline based on care and precision.

Al-Razi (Rhazes) was among the first physicians to provide a complete and precise description of diseases such as smallpox and measles and insisted on evaluating patients based primarily on audiovisual evidence and personal experience, rather than conjecture. Ibn-Sina (Avicenna), referred to sometimes as "The Prince of Physicians," composed The Canon of Medicine a great classic which provided a basic text for medical students for hundreds of years. 

Muslim scholars developed the first formal hospitals that also had parts for residents, pharmacies, and practicum sites for residents. They developed practices for surgery, anesthesia, and mental health care that were centuries ahead of everything else.

Their commitment to education and healing raised medicine above superstition and into a respected science. The spirit of generosity and inquiry demonstrated by these Muslims should and continues to encourage physicians to a greater life towards improving health care for all people today.
