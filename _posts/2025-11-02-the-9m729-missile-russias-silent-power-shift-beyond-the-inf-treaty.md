The 9M729 cruise missile, which NATO calls the SSC-8 “Screwdriver,” is arguably one of the most strategically influential and controversially debated weapons of the last century. The missile, which was initially developed within the limits imposed by the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, has become a representation of the shift in global power structure and an intensified missile race between Russia and NATO.

Conflicting statements from officials in the Ukrainian defense sector challenge the factual basis of the 9M729's capabilities. According to Kyiv, Moscow has performed conventional strikes on the deep areas of the Ukrainian territory using the 9M729 nuclear-capable missile, and in one instance, the missile went over 1,200 kilometers in October to hit its target. While the reports accompanying these allegations have not presented any missile fragments or other material evidence, these claims are becoming a concern for Western regulators of defense.

At the center of the story about the 9M729's alleged extended range, which led to the U.S. decision to exit the INF Treaty in 2019 was the abandonment of the agreement, which was signed in 1987, by the US and the USSR and banned the both sides from developing, testing or deploying 500-5500 kilometers ground-launched missiles.

The U.S. apartheid accused the Russian government of doing a stealthy test and deployment of the 9M729 beyond 500 kilometers limit range in violation of the treaty. In retaliation, Russia took an uncommon step by unsealing the missile’s details for verification of the breach publicly. Russian authorities were saying that the missile range was 480 kilometers, i.e. within the treaty limits, still, the U.S. pulled out of the agreement. Shortly thereafter, Moscow followed suit and thus the Cold War arms control which was one of the few remaining agreements didn’t stand anymore.

The 9M729 was the product of the Novator Design Bureau in Yekaterinburg, and it is a land-based cruise missile intended for high-precision targeting of the broad spectrum of enemy airfields, command and control centers, communication hubs, armored formations, and others.

The missile is fired from the Iskander-M mobile launcher, which also launches the 9M728 missile. However, the 9M729 characterizes a number of significant changes: a 500-kilogram more substantial warhead, an advanced guidance system, and improved accuracy at the terminal phase. Its guidance system incorporates inertial and Doppler drift sensors, GLONASS/GPS correction, and an active radar seeker to assure accuracy even in a contested environment.

The solid-fuel booster and a turbofan engine provide the propulsion, allowing the missile to have a subsonic cruise capability, and it can fly at low altitudes, thus it is hard to detect and intercept. The missile's aerodynamic configuration with the folding wings that get unfolded after the launch is very much like the design of the Kalibr naval cruise missile of Russia, and it suggests a common ancestor for both.

Throughout the duration of the INF Treaty, Russia was asserting that the range of the 9M729 did not exceed 500 kilometers. NATO intelligence agencies, however, based on their assessment of the system, claim that its actual range could be between 2000 and 2500 kilometers and therefore, it could reach and hit the target all over Europe from the Russian side of the border.

The cessation of the INF Treaty gave Russia a green light to further develop the 9M729 and, in all likelihood, extend its operational envelope as well. Now the 9M729 is strategically positioned as a device that can bridge the gap between short-range tactical missiles and long-range strategic systems, thus it is a versatile platform that can be used for nuclear as well as for conventional missions.

First of all, the 9M729 significantly changes the security situation in Europe and its environment. Due to its mobility, precision, and dual-capable nature, it constitutes the main part of the Russian regional deterrence posture. On the other hand, for NATO planners, this weapon is not only a threat on the battlefield but also a political statement that emphasizes that despite the technological edge of the West, Moscow is determined to achieve military parity.

Besides its tactical role, 9M729 is a symbol of the breakdown of a half-century of arms control and the beginning of a new strategic era characterized by the lack of clarity and great potential for escalation. At the same time, the post-INF era is quite challenging to predict as both Russia and the United States are considering different types of intermediate-range systems.

Whether or not Russia has employed the 9M729 against Ukrainian forces, the weapon's importance is far beyond the battlefield. It stands for a world where the old limitation have disappeared and where the balance of deterrence is no longer determined by treaties but by technology and will.
