US‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ President Donald Trump’s move to label Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally is a clear indication of a fundamental change in the U.S. Middle East policy. This upgrade in the relationship, which does not entail a mutual defence treaty, was made public in a white house gala attended by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The action at the very least confirms the closeness of U.S.–Saudi relations during a period of volatile geopolitics and shifting power balances in the Middle East.

The designation as a major non-NATO ally opens the doors to Saudi Arabia for the extended U.S. defence cooperation such as the first-rate sales of high-tech weaponry, joint research and development projects, and the prospect of stocking U.S. war-reserve material in the kingdom. According to some sources, Riyadh is now the next clientele for newly regional F-35 fighter jets that had been kept from the Middle East. It is a military upgrade that will most likely have the biggest impact on the balance of power in the region. While the DOD will be greatly increased, the U.S. will not be forced to defend Saudi Arabia militarily if war breaks out.

This choice was made when Saudi Arabia is significantly expanding its monetary influence in the US, promising to increase its invested capital from approximately 600 billion to close to 1 trillion. For Washington, this is not only a win in economic terms, but also in strategic ones, as it reinforces old defence and energy partnerships. On the other hand, the promotion gives the green light to the kingdom to infiltrate the West and gather security intelligence as well as advanced technology and also strengthen the ties with the Western military, which will function as a counter-balance to the regional rivals such as Iran.

The breaking of the news came along with hefty blows. Trump brushed off this concern about the Crown Prince's involvement in Khashoggi's murder in his face, hence, the President's view was strongly opposed by intelligence agencies of the U.S. By ignoring the human rights issues, the administration shows its preference of security and economic interests above any kind of diplomatic criticism.

The label is bound to have some nerve-wracking effects over the Middle East and the rest of the world as well. The neighbours may regard Saudi's getting a higher rank and on top of that the possible supply of cutting-edge U.S. missiles to it as something that would scare them and create instability in the area. A number of South Asian analysts including the ex-Indian Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal argue that the step might be a part of a bigger plan of strategic realignment which not only includes the blurry defence relations between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan but also Washington’s interest in redefining its position in the region.

India, in a way, gets a mixed bag here. New Delhi has great relations with both Washington and Riyadh, it benefits a lot from the Gulf when it comes to energy, investments, and the livelihood of the expatriates. So on the one hand, a more robust US–Saudi defence partnership could enhance the cooperation possibilities, on the other hand, it might heavily influence the geopolitical dynamics involving Iran and Pakistan, two countries that are key to India's strategic calculations. What India will do is carefully monitor how this change affects the regional power balances, maritime security in the Gulf, and broader Indo-Pacific connections.

In essence, Trump's move is as much about sending a message as it is about making a real difference. It is a step towards cementing one of the longest partnerships, bringing in line a bulk of hard money and military interests, and a signal of deeper American engagement with Saudi security. The real question is , will it be a slam dunk for the trade deals to happen swiftly and shortcomings of the region actors vanish, or will it turn out to be a slow progress in strategic gains hard to discern behind symbolic ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌elevation?
