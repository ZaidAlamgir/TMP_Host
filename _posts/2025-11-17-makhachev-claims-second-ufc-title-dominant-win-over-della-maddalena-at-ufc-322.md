At‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ UFC 322, Makhachev was a phenomenon, winning his second title at the UFC with a very clear decision in front of the home crowd at the Madison Square Garden, shuffled off the scene in very impassive way his opponent. All judges saw the fight 50-45 in favor of the Dagestani fighter who basically reigned (almost) alone over the entire fight, thus becoming a two-division champion and strengthening his position among the top of the sport.

Indeed in the first round, Makhachev went on to deliver a perfect strategy that relied heavily on precise leg kicks, smooth transition from standing to grappling and suffocating ground control. As it is of Della Maddalena commonly said, he delivers powerful and precise punches, but in this event he found no way to get a rhythm as Makhachev kept taking the fight to the ground. The final stats show a ground control time of over 19 minutes and Makhachev landing 140 strikes compared to 30 by Della Maddalena.

This triumph counts Islam Makhachev’s 16th consecutive UFC win, the same as Anderson Silva’s famous streak. After giving up the lightweight title earlier this year for the sake of a higher weight class, the Russian fighter brilliantly showed that he can be successful even against the toughest welterweights. It’s a gatekeeping moment and a towering landmark that latently positions Makhachev among the greatest of all time.

Conversely, for Della Maddalena, it was painfully and heavily setback caused by Makhachev. As the incumbent champion, he was blanked out by Islam’s grappling and he had scarcely any opportunities to strike. The defeat gives the signal for the learning points but youth and striking skills, these are still huge weapons which can take him to the top levels of the game in the foreseeable future, hence a comeback is not out of the books.

Talking about Islam Makhachev, his path is a blessed one. The three fight stars: Shavkat Rakhmonov, Kamaru Usman, and several other upcoming names would be willing to fight for the belt. With a burgeoning career, legacy to be made and a division to clear, Makhachev’s next move will be highly anticipated.

The event of UFC 322 will only be no more than the talk about a new title holder, but in fact it should be about the overwhelming victory of the fighter at his prime power. Islam Makhachev was more than a winner, he was a disputant of this UFC roster most openly: at 170 lbs a new standard has been laid ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌down.
