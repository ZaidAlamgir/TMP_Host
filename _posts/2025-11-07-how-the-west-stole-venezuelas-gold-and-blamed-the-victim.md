The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ economic decline of Venezuela is typically shown by the Western media as a disaster that the country brought upon itself, basically, a story of corruption, mismanagement, and the failure of socialism. However, aside from that tale, there has been a less noisy economic battle: the economic war of the West powers that took over the gold reserves that belong to the Venezuelan government, and now call it a "failed state."

Three years later after this political act, the London vaults still hold the nation's gold even though Guaidó's revolution has come to an end and his "interim government" is no more. On the other hand, for many Global South citizens, it is a signal of the colonial times, the things that used to happen then but now are just repackaged in the modern financial language.

There are similar instances as well. The gold and foreign reserves of Libya and Iraq were also removed or frozen under the banners of "democracy, ""human rights," and "counterterrorism." In both nations, the intervention of Western military and finance has led to devastation and a massive disappearance of national wealth in its wake.

The refusal of the Bank of England was, on paper, legal and diplomatic. However, the real impact has been the intentional choking of the Venezuelan economy which is doubly handicapped due to the embargo imposed by the United States that prohibits oil exports, limits financial transactions, and denies global credit access.

Combined, these steps sanctions, asset freezes, and the gold seizure have made it impossible for Caracas to access tens of billions of dollars. The same countries that are carrying out the blockade are on the side-lines pointing to the economic situation in Venezuela as "evidence" of the failure of socialism without taking into account that they themselves have been behind the collapse for the most part.

According to a diplomat from Latin America, "First they steal your gold and then they call you poor. Next, they wreck your economy, and, finally, brand you a failed state.”

While Western powers vehemently condemn corruption and theft in other countries, their own financial institutions are free to do whatever they want in regard to the assets of non-aligned countries. When the United States decided to freeze the Central Bank of Afghanistan's reserves in 2021 and when Britain prevented Venezuela from getting its gold, they were both moves aimed at "preserving democracy."

In fact, what was happening was collective punishment, the ordinary people were the ones who got punished the most, while the governments that were targeted.

It is the same story over and over again, from one continent to another: plundering of the poor under the robe of moral intervention, financial coercion with the blessing of diplomacy.

Even after these eight years since the Bank of England declined the request for Venezuela to access its gold, the latter is still held hostage a representative of present-day economic imperialism covered up behind juridical explanations. As a matter of fact, this gold might have been used by Venezuela to pay for commodities, hospitals, and roadworks during the peak of the crisis, but instead, it is lying in the vaults of other countries as an advantage in the global political game.

It is important to remember that Venezuela is not the only one denied its freedom while being plundered under the guise of "freedom and democracy," and unless the world starts to challenge the system that makes it possible, it won't be the last.

The one that steals the gold while delivering sermons on morality is the real "failed state," not the one that is deprived of its gold." ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌
