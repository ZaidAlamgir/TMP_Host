The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ joint statement of the presidents of Ukraine and France, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Emmanuel Macron, respectively, opens the list of the most important defence agreements in Europe after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. France will supply Ukraine with upscale radars and multiple air-defence systems, including SAMP/T units, in addition to a maximum of 100 Rafale multirole fighter jets as the two countries signed a long-term military cooperation plan. The pact is a milestone in the history of the Ukrainian air force and a signal of France rapidly going deeper into the commitment of helping Ukraine’s defence over time. 

It is a “historic” pact, Zelenskyy said, pointing out that Ukraine gets not only the Rafale aircraft but strong French radar systems and eight SAMP/T air-defence batteries, with each having six launchers. Macron also added that this programme comes with full armament systems, long-range munitions, drones, training, and industrial cooperation. 

The next big move of the deal follows France's earlier contribution with Mirage 2000 fighters, but the Rafale is a much higher class of technology. The three Western-supplied fighter models, F-16, Mirage 2000, and now Rafale, will bring the Ukrainian Air Force away from the Soviet era and closer to a NATO-compatible force. Although it may take a couple of years for the training of the Rafale pilots and the completion of the infrastructure, France and Ukraine are already working on the training routes and the facilities.

The pact comes at a time when the Ukrainian territories are experiencing obscene bombings using missiles and drones. The importance of enhancing Ukraine’s air defence should not be overlooked; for instance, French radars, drones, and SAMP/T units will be the means to put a protective shield over the cities, air bases, and energy installations. These networks will be linked with Ukraine’s other air defence installations of the multinational cooperative effort, which comprises Patriot, NASAMS, and IRIS-T systems too.

The agreement is a lifeline that keeps France’s influence on the scale of major European security actors without actually spending much of its defence budget. To meet the needs of the French Air Force, other customers, and Ukraine, Dassault Aviation, the producer of the Rafale, will probably have to escalate production. Moreover, the pact has the potential to serve as a springboard for collaboration on the next generation of defence components, a step that can assist Ukraine to revitalize its defence industry post-conflict.

Notwithstanding that the parties put pen to paper, it is merely a letter of intent. In other words, the fine details of the contract such as clauses, financing, and delivery timetables have yet to be agreed upon. There is some disagreement over the exact location of the cookers; however, the EU, France, and Ukraine’s future defence budget could cover the costs. Besides, Ukraine is tasked with the challenge of setting up a support center for such a high-tech aircraft as the Rafale, the center will need to have various special constructed hangars, training machines, and armory rooms among other things.

In spite of these obstacles, the equivalence and the political and tactical significance of this accord are gigantic. First and foremost, it ALLIES of Ukraine that the support they give today will not only help Kyiv to resist the aggressor but also have the capacity to deter any future aggression. China’s military reconstruction becomes more and more a European issue, where France emerges as a key pillar, and this agreement is a clear example of that.

The continuation of the Russian war of attrition certainly means that Ukraine’s access to the Rafale jet fighters and state-of the art air-defence system will probably be a major factor in controlling the ongoing battles over the next few years. Even though the time lag between the jets being delivered and them being fully operative is rather long, the point to which I want to bring is pretty obvious: it speaks volumes about Ukraine’s preparedness to be in a position to protect its airspace if not at least then at most with some of the most advanced airpower technology in the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌world.
