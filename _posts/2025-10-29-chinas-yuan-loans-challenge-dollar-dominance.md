By‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ yuan-based credit, China is rapidly intensifying its campaign to counter the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global finance. In a few countries, Beijing has started to allow the swapping of their dollar loans for yuan ones, while also providing them with lower interest rates and more comfortable repayment terms in recent months, thus the yuan is gaining a significant footprint in the Global South in a very quiet way.

The change is evident in Africa already. Just a few days ago, the Ethiopian government started negotiations with China on the possible part conversion of its $5.38 billion external debt to yuan-backed loans. Similar to this, Kenya made the announcement on October 7 that it had successfully changed three Chinese railway construction loans from dollars to yuan, thus cutting its annual debt-servicing costs by $215 million, Finance Minister John Mbadi was quoted.

On the surface, such actions may seem to be at a loss for China but analyst termed the work behind the scenes to be more strategic than charitable. China, by letting off the cheapest yuan loans, not only helps the partner countries to lower the risk of their defaults, but at the same time, she also promotes international demand for her currency. The scheme is a perfect match with Beijing’s long-term ambition of the yuan internationalization, of which the Chinese currency is being positioned as a possible replacement of the dollar for global trade and development finance.

For the ones who are heavily indebted with dollar loans carrying high interest rates, the swap with the yuan brings them some relief as well as financial independence. Besides that, China gets the chance to strengthen the economic linkages and expand her influence in Africa and other places, especially at the moment when Western financing is becoming less viable or more conditional.

Yuan loans are quickly becoming more popular, as reported by Bloomberg. After Kenya, Zambia would like to do similar things, while Hungary and Kazakhstan have floated bonds in yuan denomination. Sri Lanka is intending to take a $500 million yuan loan for an expressway project, and Indonesia is getting ready for its first offshore yuan bond offering.

The upsurge in yuan usage is a de-dollarization measure with subtle but significant implications for the global economy — i.e., over time, countries gradually reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar in trade, borrowing, and reserves. The balance of global economic power could gradually tilt towards Beijing as more countries decide to finance their projects with yuan.

On the other side, the U.S. dollar index  which is a tool measuring the dollar’s competitiveness against a basket of major currencies is still on the downward trend and the main factors responsible for that are geopolitical uncertainty and the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Despite the fact that the dollar is still the primary reserve currency of the world, China is making the latest moves as if it is a planned effort to take away that status bit by bit. By mounting strategic lending and enlarging financial diplomacy, Beijing is effecting a currency revolution through the medium of debt relief which is less noticed but impactful, one yuan loan at a ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌time.
