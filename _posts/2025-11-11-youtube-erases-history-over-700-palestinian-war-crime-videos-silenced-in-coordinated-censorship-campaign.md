YouTube,‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ in what is being called an alarming act of digital censorship, has apparently removed the archives of three major Palestinian human rights organizations, the company has erased over 700 videos that record alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.

The information was provided by U.S. journalist Ana Kasparian. Kasparian explained the action as a part of what she sees as a broader, U.S.-backed effort to “bury evidence of Israel’s war crimes.”

Kasparian said that among the videos that were removed were:

The removal of videos also led to the disappearance of more than 700 recordings of human rights violations documented by the Israeli forces;

Investigative activities related to the murder of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh;

People who have been detained giving accounts of the times when the torturers tortured them;

Documentaries and footage revealing the deaths of children caused by Israeli airstrikes.

Kasparian branded the takedown as an attack of the utmost kind on transparency and accountability. She argued that it represses victims and shelters those who have power. Our politicians are bought, she affirmed. “I want documentation of the war crimes. I want people to see the reality on the ground.”

The erased material is said to have been the work of groups that had been the key digital archives of war documentation, legal complaints, and international investigations into human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories.

Critics warn that the extensive removal not only impedes the work of journalists and researchers in accessing the evidence but also dilutes the ongoing efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice under international law.

Human rights defenders have charged YouTube with conspiring with Western political forces to improve the public image of Israel's actions during its military campaigns in the region. They claim that there is a pattern of content moderation decisions that disproportionately silence Palestinian voices, whereas the violent or dehumanizing narratives against Palestinians are allowed to continue online.

While YouTube has not made a detailed public statement about these particular deletions, the company has, in the past justified such moves under the "graphic content" and "community guidelines" policies. Nevertheless, commentators suggest that these regulations are only enforced when the documentation shows violence committed by the state but even then selectively.

This event is only one of many tech-related concerns that are raising questions about the influence the biggest tech platforms have in telling the story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Kasparian cautioned, “This isn’t just censorship — it’s the digital erasure of ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌history.”
