A senior German military official said that despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moscow still has enough military power to carry out a small-scale limited attack on NATO territory.

Lieutenant General Alexander Sollfrank, who is in charge of the Joint Operations Command in Germany, told Reuters that Russia has sustained a lot of losses on the battlefield but still "has enough military power to conduct a limited offensive - even as early as tomorrow."

Sollfrank explained that the Russian ground forces are very weak because they have been fighting for almost three years and have suffered heavy losses, however, the Russian Air Force, missile units, and nuclear weapons are still there. As the general pointed out, these are the forces that allow Moscow to rapidly carry out local military operations along NATO's eastern border if that is what it wants to do.

> "There is no sign that Russia is planning such an attack," Sollfrank said, "but from a purely military point of view, it is still within their power."

The general's statements are made while NATO is still beefing up its Eastern Europe security by adding more soldiers and updating its deterrence posture to be ready against a possible long-term Russian threat. Particularly, Germany has played a major part in strengthening Lithuania by promising a permanent brigade-sized force there by 2027.

Military analysts are of the opinion that the General's statement is an indication that strategically nothing that Russia might do is clear. Even with the heavy losses that the Russian army has sustained and the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Western countries, the latter keeps producing airborne missiles, drones, and artillery at a rate that shows its defense industry is still strong.

For NATO officials, the message is crystal clear: they think the most probable scenario is that Russia will not launch a major attack against the alliance in the near future; nevertheless, it could carry out a local or hybrid attack.

This is emphasized by the fact that Sollfrank's remarks highlight the growing awareness amongst European countries that NATO deterrence has to extend beyond Ukraine if it is to be considered ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌effective
