With‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ an 8 billion pound deal, the UK has agreed to sell Eurofighter Typhoon 20 units to Türkiye. This is the third in kind of the last few years in the history of the UK trade, where these three big export deals are mutually on the to the UK side. BAE Systems, with the signing of some agreements, and the Turkish Defence Ministry officials have led this way to commerce between both countries' defence and industrial sectors, strengthening London and Ankara’s ties amid the changing world security environment.

The people in the know gave the information that besides aircraft sales, the deal also entails complete servicing, training, and the transfer of technologies parts thus eventually deepening the partnership between the Turkish Air Force and the Eurofighter consortium. As a source of the four countries, the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, the Eurofighter Typhoon is a state-of-the-art fourth generation single-pilot aircraft model with complete air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities.

United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence, Mr. Grant Shapps, greeted it as a great industrial achievement to the UK that also gave strong support to the country's international partners. Moreover, it was the one to create or sustain thousands of top-qualifications jobs throughout the whole British defence sector, mainly in Lancashire and the rest of the production centers, the party comprising three keynote figures in the manufacturing world - BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, and GKN Aerospace said.

Meanwhile, the F-35 fighter jet procurement postponement has led the Turkish government to push for the revamp of its air force fleet. The governmental authorities of Ankara have now to look at some alternatives in the near-term while they keep working on the indigenous fifth-generation fighter, the KAAN.

According to the ruler, it is the most important and decisive tactical move that allows turning Türkiye into a reliable source of self-sufficient defence besides being able to deter potential enemies. In addition to that, the vehicles will have a dual purpose; "not only will the Typhoons be consistent with domestic defence initiatives, but they also will facilitate interoperability with NATO systems," he added.

Political analysts deem the agreement as a geopolitically pivot affecting the balance the Turkish authorities have to find among their Western friend and defence ambition whet independently. This also hints about the UK getting more into the non-EU NATO countries' circle and the possible consequences on good internal relations within the alliance.

When they’re actually handed over, the initial group of Eurofighter Typhoon units will be with the Turkish Air Force.

The agreement serves as a spyglass of the UK's drive to maintain its position among the top arms sellers in the world, while at the same time meeting growing competition from other players on the global arms market. Moreover, this means not only the augmentation of the Turkish air force but also the UK's position as one of the world's most prominent defence exporters creating a stir in the highly competitive global arms market. As a result of this transaction, the UK solidifies its position as one of the most prominent defence exporters out of the growing global competition in the arms trade, and it makes Türkiye  more powerful in the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌air.
