Director‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ General of Police (DGP) Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat said that the Nowgam explosion on Thursday was an accident and he disagreed with all the speculations and rumors that were mixed up with this incident. He added that "there was no terror attack." and asked the people not to believe that kind of talk which was posted on social media.

A fire in a shop in Nowgam, a locality on the suburban of Srinagar, led to a tragic incident where nine people lost their lives. The people who died are:

1 State Investigation Agency (SIA) official

3 Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) personnel

2 photographers

2 revenue officials

1 tailor

According to the police, the team was busy with fieldwork when the unplanned blast happened.

Besides these deaths, 27 people were also hurt, among whom were three civilians. It has also been reported that a few of the injured are in a very serious condition and are getting the best medical care in the hospitals of Srinagar.

After the incident, some Pakistan-based groups attempted to take credit for it. However, Jammu and Kashmir Police refuted these claims in absolute terms. In a communiqué, the police wrote:

> "The PAFF's or any Pakistan terror group's claim is without any ground and is made to cause trouble."

The Police pointed out that the purpose behind such statements is only to scare people and spread untruths.

DGP Nalin Prabhat confirmed that the investigation cleared the terror angle and that this unfortunate accident is the only possibility. He asked the people to follow only the official sources for news and not to share any reports which were not verified.

The government, while assuring the support to the injured, conveyed its sympathies to the bereaved families. A comprehensive investigation is going on to pinpoint the exact cause of the tragic accidental ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌occurrence.
